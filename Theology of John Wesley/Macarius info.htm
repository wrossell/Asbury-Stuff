    <P align=justify><A name=MACARIUSI></A>I. THE AUTHOR AND HIS 
WRITINGS</P></U>
    <P align=justify><A name=I1></A>1) THE AUTHOR</P></B></FONT><FONT 
    color=#7f7f7f>
    <P align=justify>The anonymous author who was thought at first to be 
    Macarius the Great, founder of Scete, was in fact a spiritual writer who 
    lived in the region between Mesopotamia and eastern Asia- Minor in the 
    second half of the fourth or in the beginning of the fifth century. The name 
    of Symeon of Mesopotamia, a promotor of Messialianism, has been suggested 
    because there are in these writings questionable opinions and ideas very 
    close to Messalianism. The attribution to Symeon, however, rests on shaky 
    premises. However it may be, Pseudo-Macarius is surely a profoundly 
    spiritual person with a good knowledge of human nature. He was very well 
    educated, had learnt much from his own milieu and from his reading and 
    contacts with others. His writings reveal him as an imaginative person, with 
    an artist's eye, who thinks pictorially rather than conceptually as he 
    treats of the Bible, nature or society, but possessed of a very clear idea 
    of the theology of the Trinity. He is clearly also a good teacher who can 
    make sublime doctrine come alive. His rather large body of writings has had 
    a great influence on posterity. </P>
    <P align=justify>According to these writings, he was the head of communities 
    of ascetics. There are indications which would lead us to believe that he 
    practised a sort of ascetic exile. He seems to have some knowledge of 
    Basil's writings as there are certain similarities in their works both in 
    vocabulary and ideas; moreover, a text of Gregory of Nyssa seems to speak of 
    Mesopotamian ascetics, "Like Abraham they have left country, family, and the 
    whole world, and keep their eyes fixed on heaven.... their lips are vowed to 
    silence... and they have a remarkable power over spirits." We have seen too 
    that Gregory's <I>Hypotyposis</I> or <I>De Instituto</I> is a parallel 
    version of Macarius' Great Letter. Probably Gregory's paraphrase was 
    intended to put the writings of Macarius through the mill once more in order 
    to distance it from Messalianism. </P></FONT><FONT color=#00007f><B>
    <P align=justify><A name=I2></A>2) WAS MACARIUS A 
    MESSALIAN?</P></B></FONT><FONT color=#7f7f7f>
    <P align=justify>We have already met the Messalians in connection with the 
    Apophthegmata (the Euchites), and in the chapter on Basil. But it is a fact 
    that there are in the writings of Macarius similarities with Messalian 
    propositions which had already been condemned by the Synod of Side (between 
    380 and 400) and subsequently by the Council of Ephesus. In Pseudo-Macarius' 
    exchanges with the brothers, which he conducted, discussions bearing on 
    Messalian ideas have come to light. But Macarius is far removed from the 
    crude deviations of the sect as reported by Theodoret and obtained by 
    trickery from the old man Adelphios: "Holy baptism is of no use to those to 
    whom it is administered; persevering prayer alone is able to put to flight 
    the demon dwelling in us. When the demons have been expelled by prayer, the 
    Holy Spirit then comes and manifests his presence visibly and to the senses, 
    freeing the body from the movement of the passions and completely liberating 
    the soul, which is no longer inclined towards evil. It is no longer 
    necessary thereafter to fast in order to tame the body nor to submit to 
    guidance in the way of righteousness. The person who has obtained this gift 
    is not only freed from the uncontrolled movements of the body but also sees 
    the future clearly and with his eyes looks on the divine Trinity." 
    (Ecclesiastical History IV, 10)</P>
    <P align=justify>Macarius is far from such extravagance; in fact he often 
    corrects extremist Messalians. Certainly there are in his works some 
    Messalian tendencies, but they are mild and, even if textual coincidences 
    may be found, these must be read in the general context of his whole work, 
    which is balanced. Macarius' position is everywhere nuanced, moderate, and 
    he acted as a moderating influence within the Messalian movement as a 
    whole.</P></FONT><FONT color=#00007f><B>
    <P align=justify>3) HIS WRITINGS</P></B></FONT><FONT color=#7f7f7f>
    <P align=justify>Macarius' writings consist of some one hundred discourses 
    or homilies dispersed in four large Greek collections and one Arab 
    collection, but the greater part of his letters appear in more than one 
    collection at once. Collection II, the Fifty Homilies, is the best known. 
    The "Great Letter", which we have already mentioned is the first item in 
    Collection I and in Collection IV. Having already dealt with Gregory's 
    Hypotyposis,, a repeat of the "Great Letter", we shall give in the Texts 
    only extracts from the Homilies. </P><U><B><I>

    <P align=justify><A name=MACARIUSII></A>II. MACARIUS' 
    DOCTRINE</P></FONT></B></U><FONT color=#7f7f7f>
    <P align=justify>Immediately on opening the works of Macarius, one is struck 
    by three rather characteristic features:</P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P align=justify><FONT face=Symbol>Þ</FONT> His insistence on evil as a 
      present entity which one must fight against; whence the theme of spiritual 
      combat present throughout. In affirming the liberty of the soul, Macarius 
      is opposed to Manicheism, but he has been influenced by the movement all 
      the same and, like the Messalians, he is obsessed by evil.</P>
      <P align=justify><FONT face=Symbol>Þ</FONT> Secondly, his insistence on 
      prayer directed towards Christ and towards the Spirit.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P align=justify><FONT face=Symbol>Þ</FONT> Thirdly, characteristic of his 
      writings is the place held by the Spirit. This links him with the Syrians, 
      above all when he speaks of the Spirit as 'Mother'. We shall take these 
      points up again, illustrating them by the 
    texts.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT><FONT color=#00007f><B>
    <P align=justify><A name=II1></A>1) A CENOBITIC 
    FRAMEWORK</P></B></FONT><FONT color=#7f7f7f>
    <P align=justify>The dotrine of Pseudo-Macarius is set within a loosely 
    cenobitic framework. Like Basil, he prefers the word 'Christian' or 
    'brother' to that of 'monk'. Charity is the reason why living in harmony is 
    expected of the 'brothers'. They separate themselves from the world and 
    renounce marriage: for Macarius these are two synonymous expressions which 
    have a spiritual finality. The organisation of the community seems quite 
    flexible; it depended on the needs of each of the brothers, who differed in 
    age, temperament, experience and spiritual gifts. Each had to co-operate 
    according to his abilities for the good of all (Text 1). We can surmise from 
    this fine text, which remains valid for all time, that for certain brothers 
    in Macarius' community prayer doubtless had a preponderant role but they 
    took advantage of it to look down on the rest.</P>
    <P align=justify>The text goes on: "What is more important than all else is 
    constancy in prayer." But Macarius does not forget that interior 
    renunciation is the condition of prayer; he goes on: "We ought to engage in 
    the fight and make war on our thoughts." Elsewhere he shows that we ought to 
    renounce our souls by handing ourselves over completely to God, which in 
    practice is done through obedience: to be "like a redeemed slave". (Great 
    Letter)</P>
    <P align=justify>Homily 56 also is devoted to the monastic life. Macarius 
    begins by giving the two meanings of the word 'monk': to be alone 
    exteriorly, and to be alone interiorly. "Let his mind itself become monkish, 
    remaining alone before God, and no longer letting in evil thoughts." He then 
    affirms that the purification of heart that that supposes, springs from 
    man's free choice and for that one needs to learn the meaning of: "Take up 
    your cross and follow me." There follow the subjects dear to the Desert 
    Fathers: patience, amerimna, nepsis, which enable us to attain that prayer 
    which will bring us charity. He ends with a description of the ups and downs 
    in the life of grace (Text 2).</P>
    <P align=justify>Homily III, 10:4 underlines the serious nature of the 
    consecrated life. It is not just a question of wearing a habit, but of 
    acquiring a new heart, without which we cannot become divinised (Text 
    3).</P></FONT><FONT color=#00007f><B>
    <P align=justify><A name=II2></A>2) ANTHROPOLOGY</P></B><I>
    <P align=justify><A name=II2a></A>a) Man</P></I></FONT><FONT color=#7f7f7f>
    <P align=justify>Of course, we find traditional ideas from Origen in 
    Macarius' anthropology: man is made up of three parts: body, soul and spirit 
    (Text 4). He is created in the image and likeness of God, and Macarius takes 
    up again the principle of homonymy developed by the Alexandrine: there are 
    two men in every man, the exterior man and the interior man, each having its 
    own meaning. For Macarius, the first is the 'old man', the second the 'new 
    man'. Like Origen also, to designate the principal faculty of the soul, he 
    uses either the word 'intellect', or the word 'heart' in the biblical sense, 
    especially Collection II. In speaking of the body, Macarius is opposed to 
    Manichean tendencies affirming that the body is not evil in itself: it is 
    "the lovely tunic of the soul" which should take care not to tear it with 
    the thorns of worry or scorch it with the fires of lust (II,4:3-4) destined 
    to be transfigured.</P>
    <P align=justify>Created in the image and likeness of God, man has kinship 
    then with him, as the Cappadocians had noted (Text 5). It is this which 
    constitutes man's dignity (Text 6). "Be conscious of your dignity" is an 
    exclamation like that which will burst from the heart of St. Leo later, but 
    is already found elsewhere: "Recognise that you are a noble creature, O man, 
    recognise your dignity and your worth: you are a brother of Christ, a friend 
    of the King, bride of the heavenly bridegroom." (II 27:1). Yet there is 
    nothing in common between the nature of God and the nature of man (III 26:8, 
    see below). </P>
    <P align=justify>But man has fallen, Adam first and we afterwards (Text 7). 
    The rest of the text shows that Christ has come to restore man's lost image: 
    "He renews and remakes a heavenly image and brings forth a new soul. Thus 
    Adam recovers his sway over death and his lordship of creation." As with the 
    Greek Fathers, the Incarnation is the instrument of our salvation, for in 
    assuming our nature, in taking our body, the Saviour has blended them with 
    the Holy Spirit so that our nature might receive "the heavenly soul" (II 
    36:6). Salvation then is obtained through the contact of the divinity with 
    the humanity. By his body which came into contact with death, Christ-God 
    destroyed death: "It is by means of a dead body that our enemy was put to 
    death" (II 52:2). But we have to co-operate with this salvation. First, by 
    believing in order to be healed (Text 8), then by weeping in order to 
    receive the Spirit (Text 9). (See also III 26:3,5, below).</P></FONT>

          color=#7f7f7f><BR>1-3 People in the world are complex beings, troubled 
          by ceaseless and unquiet thoughts, by dread, by fear, by unease and by 
          their own cravings.<BR><BR>4-5 On the contrary, after many a struggle 
          and after a long time, Christians do achieve stability, freedom from 
          agitation. They are at peace.<BR><BR>6 The dew of the Spirit has found 
          its way in, their heart has been smitten by love for Christ, the King 
          of heaven. Straining towards him, they free themselves from all love 
          of the world, break every earthly tie. <BR><BR>7 But they are few who 
          break every tie with the world in this way.<BR><BR>8-9 To do it, they 
          have to renounce their own will, renounce themselves.<BR><BR>10 For 
          our love is what weighs us down.<BR><BR>11 If we love what is earthly 
          and fleshly, our love keeps us chained, preventing us from taking 
          flight towards God.<BR><BR>12 On the contrary, the person who directs 
          all his love towards God and renounces himself, comes through all 
          difficulties and trials.<BR><BR>13 For our love is what weighs us 
          down. It is a burden, or it is light according to what we love: the 
          things of heaven or the things of earth.<BR><BR>14-17 Different 
          examples show that renunciation, self-stripping contribute to our 
          salvation.<BR><BR>18 Conclusion: love God alone, strip oneself of all 
          earthly love.<BR><BR>19 This is why asceticism is necessary, whereas 
          we would prefer the rewards without having to make the 
          effort.<BR><BR>20 Within trials, within sufferings borne with patience 
          and in faith, are hidden our glory and the restoration of our heavenly 
          inheritance.<BR><BR>21 By means of the spiritual combat, the practice 
          of the virtues and of faith, we build ourselves a heavenly house to 
          replace that of our body. It is the power of the Holy Spirit dwelling 
          in us which brings this about.<BR><BR>22 Let us struggle on then so as 
          not to be found naked when we shall have put off our body but, through 
          our sharing in the Holy Spirit, be reclothed with the treasures we are 
          garnering now. The trees which are covered once more with leaves and 
          flowers in the spring are an image of Christians at the 
          resurrection.<BR><BR>23 This is why April is the most important month 
          for the true Christian. It is the time of resurrection when our bodies 
          will be glorified by the power of the Holy Spirit who already dwells 
          in them.<BR><BR>24 Moses prefigured the glory with which the Holy 
          Spirit will clothe the bodies of the saints.<BR><BR>25 In the 
          resurrection we shall have the wings of the Holy Spirit to bear us 
          whithersoever the Spirit wills.<BR><BR>26 Whence the benefit of

    <P align=justify><A name=II2b></A>b) The spiritual 
    combat</P></B></I></FONT><FONT color=#7f7f7f>
    <P align=justify>The spiritual combat finds a place in this falleness of man 
    redeemed by Christ, for Christ himself had to fight to redeem sin (Text 10). 
    Macarius still depends on Origen for this idea of the spiritual combat, 
    present everywhere in his work. But if in Origen man could, by reason of his 
    freedom, consent either to the pull of the flesh or to that of the Spirit, 
    in Macarius who reifies evil, man is poised between grace and evil; his 
    free-will will make him incline towards the one or the other. Man then must 
    do violence to himself (Text 11). Discernment is necessary to carry on this 
    fight (Text 12). If a person fights to the best of his ability, if he does 
    violence to himself, God will make his efforts fruitful (Text 13). Homily 5, 
    an outline of which we give on the previous page, stresses the role of 
    asceticism and of the spiritual combat in the life of the 
    'christian'.</P></FONT><FONT color=#00007f><I><B>
    <P align=justify><A name=II2c></A>c) The virtues, 
    humility</P></B></I></FONT><FONT color=#7f7f7f>
    <P align=justify>The spiritual combat is a factor of growth, and opens up 
    the possibility of overcoming vice and acquiring virtue. All the virtues 
    hold together - a stoic conception prevalent in Basil, and also found in 
    Macarius (Text 14). Virtue is the opposite of vice. As in the Desert 
    Fathers, the most difficult vice to overcome is pride, so very special 
    attention is given to the virtue of humility. Macarius often comes back to 
    it. Humility makes good sense (Text 15). It is characteristic of the 
    Christian (Text 16). Humility often finds expression in tears, which are the 
    nourishment of the soul and the sign of its desire (Text 17). A fine text 
    (Text 18), sums up rather well the process to be undergone: faith, obedience 
    through asceticism, the spiritual combat, should culminate in humility.</P>

    <P align=justify><A name=II3a></A>a) Christ</P></B></I></FONT><FONT 
    color=#7f7f7f>
    <P align=justify>We spoke above of the Incarnation. If Christ has come to 
    save us, it is in order to bring us the Spirit, who will mould us into his 
    likeness. Macarius' language is not strictly theological even if at the 
    beginning of the Great Letter, he makes a profession of faith that is close 
    to that of Constantinople (381) and on occasion expresses a Christology that 
    is accurate and carefully phrased (I,10:4). What he aims to do is awaken the 
    love of the Saviour and the desire to imitate him. Indeed, Christ became 
    incarnate and 'mingled' with his creatures so that we might imitate him 
    (Text 19). This Incarnation is reproduced now in those who seek Christ (Text 
    20). It is clear from this text that in order to speak of Christ, who adapts 
    himself to the needs of each, Macarius takes up the 'epinoïai' (thought) of 
    Origen. Thus is Christ born spiritually in the soul (Text 21). Through his 
    Passion he will seek out death, dispute with it and snatch the souls it 
    holds in its grasp (III, 11). This Passion too is offered for our imitation 
    (Text 22).</P></FONT><FONT color=#00007f><I><B>

    color=#7f7f7f>
    <P align=justify>We are struck, on reading the Homilies, by the place 
    accorded to the Holy Spirit and his relationship with Christ. This feature 
    links Macarius with the Syrians. The images used to describe the action of 
    the Spirit are manifold. One occurring most frequently is that of wings. 
    "The souls of the saints possess these wings even now to enable their minds 
    to fly up towards heavenly thoughts" (II,5:25). At the resurrection they 
    will "cover and clothe the naked bodies anew and take them up to heaven" 
    (id.). Another image with a platonic flavour: "Holy souls are impelled and 
    guided by the Spirit of Christ, who holds the reins" (II,1:9). The Spirit is 
    also heavenly nourishment, salt and heavenly yeast (II,24), heavenly 
    treasure, heavenly light. He is a garment, for the soul is poor and naked 
    when it is bereft of communion with the Spirit (II,18:3 &amp; elsewhere). 
    This good Spirit and friend of men is at once dew (II,5:6) and a fire which 
    sweeps away the thorns (II,15:53).</P>
    <P align=justify>It is he that teaches us true prayer: he collects our 
    scattered thoughts, lifts them up to heaven, becoming as it were the wings 
    of the soul (III,18:2). He teaches us humility and comes to pray in us (Text 
    23). It is in the Spirit that divine life unfolds; he assimilates us to 
    Christ, etches in us the image of Christ (II,30:4-5). Thus communion with 
    the Holy Spirit is sometimes union with the Spirit, sometimes a nuptial 
    union with Christ in the Spirit. It is he that wounds the soul with love for 
    Christ.</P>

          HOMILY II, 18: THE TREASURE OF THE SPIRIT<BR></FONT><FONT 
          color=#7f7f7f><BR><BR>1 Christ and the Spirit are a treasure within, 
          enabling us to practise all the virtues and thus increase our 
          spiritual riches.<BR><BR>2 Let us beg God to give us the treasure that 
          is his Spirit, without whom we are needy and naked.<BR><BR>3 The 
          possession of the Lord, this true treasure, enables us to bring forth 
          the fruits of the Spirit, to accomplish all justice, to observe all 
          the commandments.<BR><BR>4 Example of a rich person who has all the 
          resources to give a banquet, and of a poor person who has to borrow 
          everything, pay it back afterwards and, when he has done so, finds 
          himself as poor as ever.<BR><BR>5 Also, those who are richly endowed 
          with the Holy Spirit, draw upon their own wealth to do good to others. 
          But the person less well endowed borrows from the spiritually wealthy 
          person and, after he has communicated these goods, remains poor and 
          naked. He is neither happy nor filled with the joy of the 
          Spirit.<BR><BR>6 We ought, then, to pray God to let us find his own 
          riches in our heart: the true treasure which is Christ together with 
          the vigour of the Spirit. After having found it, we shall try to be of 
          help to others by explaining the heavenly mysteries.<BR><BR>7-9 Those 
          who bear Christ within, giving them light and repose, are guided by 
          the Holy Spirit, by grace working within them. The action of the Holy 
          Spirit in the soul is described under the following images: a banquet, 
          repose of the bride within the arms of the bridegroom, angelic 
          lightness, divine intoxication, the gift of tears, intense joy, ardour 
          in the combat, repose, possession of wisdom.<BR><BR>10 The person who 
          is united with the Spirit becomes all light, all eye, all spirit, all 
          joy, all gentleness, all happiness, all charity, all compassion, all 
          goodness and all sweetness.<BR></P>
          <P align=justify>One characteristic of Macarius with regard to the 
          Spirit, is to present him as a Mother, which demonstrates still more 
          his dependence on Syrian spirituality. In several places in Collection 
          II, he depicts the Christian as a child (15:26) and even as a quite 
          small child (31:4; 45:7) calling for his mother (Text 24).</P>
          <P align=justify>But in Collection III, this mother is the Holy 
          Spirit. The subject is treated at length in Homily 27. After a passage 
          very like Text 24, in which he presents the soul as a very small child 
          who can do nothing much but cry for his mother, Macarius continues 
          (Text 25).</FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><FONT color=#00007f>

    <P align=justify><A name=II4></A>4) PRAYER</P></B></FONT><FONT 
color=#7f7f7f>
    <P align=justify>According to this last text, prayer is a cry to God, 
    therefore the expression of desire. But we know enough of Macarius now, his 
    insistence on asceticism, the spiritual combat, to be sure that in his 
    scheme of things prayer will not be isolated from good works. In his Great 
    Letter, Macarius presents it as being the crown of the virtues: "The crown 
    of all good zeal and the summit of all virtuous practices is perseverance in 
    prayer, thanks to which we can each day obtain the other virtues by 
    imploring them of God". This cry to God which is prayer, Text 25 explains - 
    and the same thing is found in quite a few other places in the Homilies - 
    attracts the Spirit, who gives his grace in order to help us practise the 
    virtues. Macarius also opposes the extremist Messalians who consider that 
    prayer is sufficient and so dispenses with the works of virtue (Text 26). He 
    also reproves those among them who think that prayer should be externalised 
    by loud utterances. He shows them, on the contrary, that such 
    externalisation should be excluded as it can only disturb other people, and 
    that the essence of prayer resides in one's inner attention (Text 27). In 
    the next text, Macarius distinguishes between two kinds of recollection, one 
    that might be called active, the result of personal effort, and the other, 
    the reward of such effort, brought about passively by God's action. We have 
    already seen this in Text 13; the same idea is taken up again here (Text 
    28).</P>
    <P align=justify>Everything can be a help to prayer: the acknowledgement of 
    our ills and our poverty (Text 29) just as much as the contemplation of 
    natural reality (Text 30). To the purified soul all things are pure and all 
    things lead to God (Text 31). Then, continual prayer - the continual 
    remembrance of God - is reached (Text 32).</P>
    <P align=justify>Once purified, the soul becomes fit to receive within 
    itself the prayer of the Spirit. It is a higher degree of prayer, therefore, 
    that Macarius distinguishes from 'natural' prayer and which he calls 'true 
    prayer'. In it the Spirit teaches the soul the mysteries of God directly 
    (Text 23).</P></FONT><FONT color=#00007f><B>
    <P align=justify><A name=II5></A>5) THE SUMMIT</P></B></FONT><FONT 
    color=#7f7f7f>
    <P align=justify>Macarius speaks with an air of personal assurance when he 
    describes these high degrees of mystical union (Text 33). He explains in 
    Homily 17 that the friends of the king, used to the customs of the royal 
    palace, are not discomforted when they become kings. "Just so Christians who 
    are being prepared to reign in the age to come, will not be discomforted 
    since they have come to know the secrets of grace beforehand" (4). He goes 
    on (Text 34). </P>
    <P align=justify>But perfection is not completion: these sublime graces whet 
    the appetite of the soul even more, for God is infinite while man is a 
    finite being who can never exhaust the Godhead. The theme of epectasis dear 
    to Gregory of Nyssa, is also found in Macarius (Text 35). There is no worse 
    danger than saying, "It is enough, we now need nothing more." For "the Lord 
    is infinite and unattainable and Christians do not venture to say that they 
    have attained him, but remain humble, seeking him day and night" (II,26:17). 
    Or again (Text 36).</P>
    <P align=justify>This is because we are still on earth and this perfection 
    attained here by the saints is but a foretaste of what will be granted then 
    when, after the resurrection, "the risen body will be covered with a new and 
    divine garment and nourished with heavenly food" (II,12:14).</P>

          HOMILY III, 26: THE DESTINY OF THE CHRISTIAN<BR></FONT><FONT 
          color=#7f7f7f><BR><BR>1 Christian hope does not look to this earth. 
          Its object is greater than the earth, greater <BR>than heaven. It 
          gives itself to the pursuit of the Good and the Beautiful. <BR><BR>2 
          The Good, the Beautiful, is the Lord, the inheritance and the life of 
          the Christian. <BR>Before him, man is free. God asks of him faith and 
          love. <BR><BR>3 God alone can free us from sin. He frees from sin 
          those who believe in him and love <BR>him. To believe in the Lord, to 
          love him, depends on you.<BR>Example of a sick person who, though 
          unable to move, is on the look out for the doctor. <BR>So also, even 
          though the soul can do little, it can always call on God.<BR>4 Another 
          example of a sick person, but seen from a different angle: just as a 
          sick person, <BR>laid low by fever, cannot work on the land, so "the 
          one who has been judged worthy of <BR>the heavenly fire of the Spirit 
          of life and who is possessed by the power of the divine fire, <BR>is 
          hindered from giving himself to the works of sin, drawn as he is by 
          love and affection <BR>for the divine Spouse." <BR>Greatness of the 
          soul: at once in the body and outside the body, it is destined to be 
          the dwelling of God, and is made in his image.<BR><BR>5 Return to the 
          idea developed in 3, but taking a prisoner as example. The soul is in 
          a prison. As a prisoner can only cry out for someone to open up for 
          him, the soul can only cry to the Lord and wait for the advent of his 
          grace.<BR><BR>6 When the soul clings to the Lord, the Lord "takes pity 
          on it, loves it and clings to it." <BR>"The soul becomes one spirit 
          with the Lord, one only alloy, one only thought." <BR>The soul has 
          entered into possession of the Lord in heaven, the Lord has taken 
          possession of the soul on earth.<BR><BR>7 The greatness of the soul, 
          created by God to be a bride who can be united with him and <BR>become 
          one spirit with him.<BR><BR>8 Nevertheless, what a difference between 
          the Creator and the creature! And yet, in his love and infinite mercy, 
          God has willed that we be united with him, partners with him, that we 
          be his bride, noble and pure, and destined endlessly to rejoice in his 
          presence. <BR></FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

    <P align=justify>1. II, 3:1-2</P>
    <P align=justify>The brothers should live together in great love whatever 
    they are doing, whether praying, reading the Scriptures, or working at some 
    task, in order to obtain that mutual charity which is the foundation of all. 
    God will then be pleased with their pursuits and those who pray, those who 
    read and those who work can build each other up reciprocally in sincerity 
    and simplicity....</P>
    <P align=justify>The brothers should be loving and cheerful towards each 
    other as they go about their tasks. Let the one who is working say of the 
    brother who is praying: "The treasure which my brother gathers belongs to me 
    too, as it is held in common." For his part, let the brother who is praying 
    say of the brother who is reading, "The profit which my brother draws from 
    his reading enriches me as well." And the brother who is working should say 
    in his turn, "The service which I render is a help to everybody." For just 
    as the members of the body though many form but one body and help each 
    other, while each is engaged in its own task - just as the eye sees for the 
    whole body, the hand acts for the other members, just as the foot walks 
    sustaining them all, so ought the brothers to behave towards each other.</P>
    <P align=justify>Let him who is praying not judge the person who is working, 
    saying, "Why is he not praying?" He who is working should not judge the 
    person praying, saying, "He is lingering over his prayer while I am 
    working." Let him who is serving not judge the others, but let each one, 
    whatever he is doing, do it for the glory of God. The person reading will 
    experience joy and love for the person praying if he says, "He is praying 
    for me." And he who is praying will think of the one working, "What he does, 
    he does for the common good."</P>
    <P align=justify>2. II, 56:7</P>
    <P align=justify>Sometimes through the effect of grace his soul rejoices 
    interiorly, for the Saviour can be both thoroughly demanding and kind. But 
    often, too, consolation goes and grace allows Satan to buffet him. Satan 
    rouses his evil passions, makes him sleepy, subject to acedia and atony (out 
    of sorts) and lots of other things that cannot be described. All this 
    happens, so that in his pain and sorrow he may call on the Lord with 
    steadfast faith and tire himself out in prayer. Then once more, if it sees 
    him persevere and truly seeking God's mercy, grace frees him from all 
    vexations of the enemy. Then it makes his heart merry, as was indeed 
    intended, and purifies it of all the guile of the enemy. Indeed, it desires 
    that man should not obtain grace except at the price of struggle and effort; 
    it does not want a man to experience only sweetness so that his mind may not 
    become lazy but rather vigilant and committed to the war against Satan.</P>
    <P align=justify>3. III, 10:4</P>
    <P align=justify>You will find those who have renounced the world, but whose 
    soul is sick... There are many who wear a habit exteriorly but their 
    understanding is weakened, and they wander aimlessly for ever. They need to 
    acquire a new heart, a heavenly understanding in the interior man, a divine 
    soul within the soul, a body in the body, so that they may become a twofold 
    being. You give your trust: trust will be given you in return; you love: you 
    will be loved in return; you acknowledge God: he will acknowledge you in 
    return; for over and above his nature, man receives a reality which is 
    foreign to him, a good that is heavenly, and he becomes a twofold being. 
</P>
    <P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
    <P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
    <P align=justify>4. II, 32:6</P>
    <P align=justify>Man was created in the image and likeness of God; he has 
    two eyes, two eyebrows, two hands, two feet. If it should happen that he 
    only has but one eye, one hand, one foot, he is incomplete. If a bird has 
    only one wing, it cannot fly. It is the same with human nature: if it is not 
    united with the heavenly nature and in fellowship with it, it is not what it 
    ought to be; it remains naked and defective, reduced to its own measure, and 
    full of uncleanness. Is not the soul called precisely the temple and 
    dwelling-place of God, and the spouse of the King? Indeed it is said, "I 
    will dwell with them and walk with them." This is why God was pleased to 
    come down from the holy heavens and assume your rational nature, assume your 
    flesh which was taken from the earth and mingle them with his own divine 
    Spirit, so that you, yes, you, earthy as you are, should receive a heavenly 
    soul. </P>
    <P align=justify>And when your soul enters into communion with the Spirit 
    and the heavenly soul penetrates your own, you are in God a perfect man, his 
    co-heir and son.</P>
    <P align=justify>5. II, 45:5</P>
    <P align=justify>God created the heavens and the earth, the sun and the 
    moon, the waters, fruit-bearing trees and living things of all kinds. But in 
    none of them does God find rest. The whole of creation is subject to him, 
    but he has not established his throne in it nor entered into union with it. 
    His delight has been only in man. He has entered into communion with him and 
    in him he finds his rest. Do you see now the kinship of God with man and man 
    with God? This is why the wise and prudent, who have surveyed the whole 
    range of creatures, fail to find their rest save in the Lord and why the 
    Saviour took his delight in none of these creatures save only man. </P>
    <P align=justify>6. II, 15:43-44</P>
    <P align=justify>Christians know that the soul is more precious than all 
    created things, for man alone has been created in the image and likeness of 
    God. Look at the heavens, how great they are! And the earth, and all the 
    great and precious things it contains! Nevertheless man is more precious 
    than they, for God's goodness has been reserved for him alone. And yet, the 
    monsters of the sea, the mountains, the wild beasts appear outwardly to be 
    greater than man. Be aware, then, of your dignity. See how precious you are 
    whom God has placed above the angels in coming himself to help and redeem 
    you.</P>
    <P align=justify>God and his angels came to save you. The King, the Son of 
    the King, held council with his Father, and the Word of God was sent, 
    clothed with human flesh, his divinity hidden, so that like might be saved 
    by like, and he gave his life on the cross. Such is God's love for men. He 
    who is immortal chose to be crucified for you. See, how "God has so loved 
    the world as to give his only Son for it." "How with him, will he not give 
    us everything?" The soul, then, is great indeed. What value it has in the 
    eyes of God! For God and his angels seek its fellowship with them and in 
    their kingdom!</P>
    <P align=justify>7. II, 11:5</P>
    <P align=justify>Adam had been created pure by God in order that he should 
    serve him, while the other creatures had been given to him for his service. 
    He was indeed appointed king and lord of all creatures. When the evil word 
    approached and conversed with him, he did not at first entertain it except 
    outwardly with his ears, but then it penetrated into his heart and took 
    possession of his whole self. When he was thus reduced to captivity, the 
    whole of creation which served him and was subject to him, became captive 
    with him. Through him death came to reign over every soul; through his 
    disobedience the image of God in him was completely effaced.</P>
    <P align=justify>8. II, 20:8</P>
    <P align=justify>If the Lord came on earth and was so concerned for bodies 
    destined to corruption, how much more concerned must he have been for the 
    immortal soul created in his likeness? It is because of our lack of faith, 
    because we draw back, because we do not love him with all our heart and do 
    not truly believe in him, that we have not obtained spiritual healing and 
    salvation. Let us believe in him, then, let us really draw near to him so 
    that he may speedily bring about true healing in us.</P>
    <P align=justify>9. II, 20:1</P>
    <P align=justify>If a person be despoiled of the divine and heavenly 
    garment, that is to say, the power of the Spirit, let him weep and implore 
    the Lord so as to receive from heaven the spiritual garment with which to 
    cover his denuded soul with the divine energy. For he who does not wear the 
    garment of the Spirit is covered with the great shame of his disreputable 
    passions. </P>
    <P align=justify>10. I, 55;3</P>
    <P align=justify>Let us be like the anvil which does not yield under the 
    hammer, no trace of softness, carelessness or boredom under the blows of 
    affliction; if we are struck, let us overcome our adversary by patience. For 
    our Saviour went through the world under the rain of blows, insults, 
    persecution, mockery and spit; finally, impious men subjected him to the 
    vile punishment of death on a cross. He bore it all for our salvation, 
    leaving us a living example so that those who really believe in him and 
    would become co-heirs with him might advance on the same way of temptation, 
    affliction and death. Through great suffering, through dying finally on the 
    cross, he emerged the victor. Crucified, he has crucified and, dying, he has 
    condemned and put to death sin committed in the flesh. He has destroyed the 
    hostile powers.</P>
    <P align=justify>If we endure with alacrity and courage every infliction and 
    assault by the Evil One, 'even unto death', then we too shall overcome the 
    adversary through our faith, patience and hope in the Lord; once proved 
    worthy, we shall be set free. We shall be filled with the holiness of the 
    Spirit and become heirs of eternal life, which comes from him. </P>
    <P align=justify>11.53:15-16</P>
    <P align=justify>The person who would truly be a Christian must submit to 
    toil and a struggle, not of the flesh but of the mind, against his thoughts. 
    With all his strength of will he must accustom himself to rest in thoughts 
    that are good and pure, to direct his mind to what is right, at every moment 
    awaiting in faith the visit of the Spirit. By means of such a struggle, he 
    will arrive at purification so that he can turn to his own edification 
    whatever he sees in the world, bringing pure thoughts to bear on 
    everything....</P>
    <P align=justify>He that would always escape the thoughts suggested by the 
    Evil One should be sure to provide himself with a shelter and refuge in the 
    Lord, ceaselessly keeping in his heart the thought of him and trusting in 
    him. Thus he will combat the evils which overwhelm us, whether they be from 
    the external world or from the evil powers within, and altogether get rid of 
    bad habits or sinful dispositions. Through such combat, while holding on to 
    their hope in God, have the Fathers won his favour.</P>
    <P align=justify>12. II, 4:1</P>
    <P align=justify>Those who would lead a strictly Christian life should above 
    all concentrate all their attention and energy on exercising the soul's 
    faculty of understanding and discernment. It is in acquiring a sure grasp of 
    good and evil, in distinguishing always between pure nature and those 
    passions contrary to nature, that we shall find it possible to lead a 
    straightforward and upright life. Using the faculty of discernment as a kind 
    of eye, we shall be able to live without getting bound or mixed up with evil 
    suggestions; we shall then be judged worthy of receiving divine gifts and 
    become worthy of the Lord.</P>
    <P align=justify>13. II, 19:3</P>
    <P align=justify>When any one draws near to the Lord, he must at first do 
    violence to himself in order to accomplish what is right even if his heart 
    is not in it, and always hope for God's mercy with invincible faith. Let him 
    do violence to himself in order to love without love, to be gentle without 
    gentleness, to be compassionate and merciful; let him do violence to himself 
    in order to bear contempt, to remain patient when scorned, not to be angry 
    when he is held of no account or disgraced, according to the saying: 
    "Beloved, do not seek revenge." Let him do violence to himself in order to 
    pray without the ability to pray spiritually. </P>
    <P align=justify>When God sees how he is struggling and doing violence to 
    himself, although his heart is not in it, he will give him true spiritual 
    prayer, true charity, true gentleness, sincere compassion, true goodness - 
    in a word, he will fill him with the gifts of the Holy Spirit.</P>
    <P align=justify>14. II, 40:1</P>
    <P align=justify>About which activity to prefer or put first, know this, 
    beloved: all the virtues stand together and form a spiritual chain, as it 
    were. The one is linked to the other, prayer to charity, charity to joy, joy 
    to gentleness, gentleness to humility, humility to the will to serve, the 
    will to serve to hope, hope to faith, faith to obedience, obedience to 
    simplicity. The same thing is true for the opposing camp in which the vices 
    stand together no less: hate is linked to anger, anger to pride, pride to 
    vain glory, vain glory to weak faith, weak faith to hardness of heart, 
    hardness of heart to negligence, negligence to soft living, soft living to 
    boredom, boredom to want of patience, want of patience to the love of 
    pleasure.</P>
    <P align=justify>15. I, 54:5,3</P>
    <P align=justify>If God wished to enquire into and draw up a balance sheet, 
    nothing would be found there to man's credit. The wealth and all the goods 
    of the world, thanks to which each one can do some good, all these belong to 
    God. Who has made the earth and all that is in it? Who created the body and 
    who made the soul? If God wills it, the earth causes the plants to grow; if 
    he does not so will, nothing grows. If he wills it, you enjoy good health; 
    if he does not so will, you are not well. Why, then, should man take credit 
    to himself for this state of things, or be proud of it or pretend to be 
    something? Everything is in God's hand; man possesses everything because he 
    has received it; he possesses it as a gift. Being itself he possesses as a 
    gift, and to a large extent he finds his peace thus: the soul acknowledging 
    God with a true and enlightened understanding and a sure knowledge, fully 
    informed by faith, and having learnt how things really stand, attributes to 
    God everything good which it does, all the labours it endures for him and 
    all that it understands and knows; it refers everything to him, does not 
    think that it has achieved anything whatsoever but ascribes to God, itself, 
    and all that it has.</P>
    <P align=justify>16. II, 15:17</P>
    <P align=justify>If you see someone standing tall and puffed up with pride 
    because of graces received, note well that, even if he works miracles and 
    raises the dead, if he has not got a humble and lowly opinion of himself, is 
    not poor in spirit and despised, he is a prey to evil without even realising 
    it. In spite of his miracles, he is not to be trusted.</P>
    <P align=justify>For it is a mark of the Christian who is pleasing to God to 
    try and remain hidden from the eyes of men and, even if he has all the 
    treasures of the King, to conceal them and say often: "They do not belong to 
    me; someone else has confided them to me and will reclaim them when he feels 
    like it."</P>
    <P align=justify>But if someone says, "I am well-off, I have all I need; my 
    fortune is made, I need nothing more", he is not a Christian but deluded and 
    a tool of the devil. </P>
    <P align=justify>Once one has savoured God, desire for him becomes 
    insatiable. The more one tastes, the more one eats, the more one is hungry. 
    Those who have experienced this burn with a passionate and wholly 
    spontaneous love towards God. The more they strive to progress and advance, 
    the more they think thmselves poor, indigent and wanting everything. They 
    say: "I am not worthy even to have the sun shining on me." Humility like 
    this is the mark of the Christian. </P>
    <P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
    <P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
    <P align=justify>17. II, 25:8</P>
    <P align=justify>The tears which spring from a really great affliction and 
    from an anguished heart, which is both in possession of the truth and burns 
    with interior ardour, are nourishment for the soul provided by the Bread 
    which came down from heaven. This bread was shared with Mary, as she sat in 
    tears at the feet of the Saviour, as he himself testified: "Mary has chosen 
    the better part which shall not be taken away from her." What precious 
    pearls these blessed tears! What docility and eagerness to hear! What 
    courage and wisdom! What keenness of spirit, inspiring a passionate love of 
    the immaculate Spouse! What burning desire of the soul for the God the Word! 
    What intimate communion of bride and heavenly bridegroom!</P>
    <P align=justify>18. II, 19:1</P>
    <P align=justify>He who would draw near to the Lord, would be deemed worthy 
    of eternal life, and become the dwelling-place of Christ, would be filled 
    with the Holy Spirit in order to bear the fruits of this same Spirit and 
    obey purely and without reproach the precepts of Christ, should in the first 
    place firmly believe in the Lord, then commit himself without reserve to his 
    commandments, completely renouncing the world so that his mind may be no 
    longer occupied with anything visible. He ought always to persevere in 
    prayer, continually on the watch, in confident expectation of the Lord, for 
    his coming and his help and always keeping this as his one goal in life.</P>
    <P align=justify>He ought further to do violence to himself because of the 
    sin in him, in order to accomplish all that is right and observe the 
    commandments of the Lord. Let him then be humble before all others, see 
    himself as the meanest and worst of all, not seek honour, praise or glory 
    from men as the Gospel says, but have continually before his eyes nothing 
    but the Lord and his commandments and desire to please none but him in 
    complete meekness of heart, as the Saviour says, "Learn of me because I am 
    gentle and humble of heart, and you will find rest for your souls." </P>
    <P align=justify>19. II, 4:9-10</P>
    <P align=justify>The infinite, inaccessible, uncreated God, in his gentle, 
    infinite and inconceivable goodness, took a body to himself. He became 
    small, as it were, with respect to his inaccessible glory, so that he might 
    be united with his invisible creatures, I mean the angels, and the souls of 
    the saints, to enable them to share in the life of the godhead. By nature 
    the angel, the demon, the human soul, though subtle certainly, are all 
    bodies, but in their substance, properties and form, they are subtle bodies 
    in keeping with the subtlety of their nature, while our bodies in keeping 
    with their substance are dense bodies. The soul, which is subtle, lays hold 
    of the eye by which it sees, the ear by which it hears, the tongue by which 
    it speaks, the hands - in a word, the whole body. Grasping the body thus, 
    the soul is mingled with it and through it performs all its vital 
    activities.</P>
    <P align=justify>In the same way, the infinite and incomprehensible God, in 
    his gentle goodness made himself small and, coming down from his 
    inaccessible glory, took the members of our body which he likewise laid hold 
    of. In love and meekness, he changed himself, took a body, mingles with holy 
    souls who are pleasing and faithful to him, grasps them and in the words of 
    St Paul becomes one spirit with them.</P>
    <P align=justify>20. idem, 11</P>
    <P align=justify>In his indescribable kindness, his meek and 
    incomprehensible goodness, He who is as he wills and what he wills, can 
    transform himself, become small and, taking a body, assimilate himself to 
    holy, worthy and faithful souls to enable them to see the Unseen and to 
    touch the Untouchable by means of the subtle nature of the soul. In this way 
    these souls become conscious of his sweetness and, through the experience of 
    his kindness, revel in the rays of an unspeakable delight.</P>
    <P align=justify>When he wills, he becomes a fire which burns up all evil 
    passions coming from outside, as it is said: "Our God is a consuming fire." 
    When he wills, he becomes inexpressible and unimaginable rest so that the 
    soul may rejoice in the divine repose. When he wills, he becomes joy and 
    peace to warm and coddle the soul.</P>
    <P align=justify>21. III,28:2,1.</P>
    <P align=justify>Let the wise virgin realise that she must bear Christ 
    within herself as Mary did; as Mary bore him in her womb, you ought to bear 
    him in your heart. You will then be able to sing and understand the psalms, 
    saying, "So are we in your presence: we have conceived, we writhe as if we 
    were giving birth; we have not given the spirit of salvation to the earth." 
    (LXX).</P>
    <P align=justify>22. III, 6:4</P>
    <P align=justify>You that live in poverty, draw down the wealth of heaven 
    thanks to this very poverty... In penury or in poverty do not lose your 
    ardour. Keep as your model and as your goal the Lord, who trod the same 
    path. </P>
    <P align=justify>When you are tired and your body is in pain, remember the 
    Lord's body, how he was struck by Pilate and how he suffered moving from 
    place to place. When you have no roof over your head, remember that the Lord 
    of creation when he was here on earth, said, "Foxes have holes and the birds 
    of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to rest his head." 
    When you walk, remember that the feet of the Lord were covered with dust all 
    the time that he was on earth, except once when he was seated on an ass in 
    order to fulfil the prophecy. When your eyes fill with tears, remember that 
    the Lord wept for your fall, imploring the Father with cries and tears that 
    you might escape death. When you are mocked, think of the blows and the 
    spitting that were his lot and hold fast in your humiliation. Likewise 
    reflect, when you lie on the ground, that it is no harder than the crown of 
    thorns that was placed on his head.</P>
    <P align=justify>23. II, 19:9</P>
    <P align=justify>The Spirit himself will teach us that true prayer which is 
    at present beyond our power even when we force ourselves to it. He will 
    teach us true humility, which we are incapable of now even by doing violence 
    to ourselves. The same goes for compassion of heart, gentleness and all the 
    commandments of the Lord. He will teach us to observe them in truth without 
    difficulty or duress, for the Spirit is able to fill us with his gifts. If 
    we obey in this way the precepts of God, through the action of his Spirit 
    who alone knows the will of the Lord, if this Spirit renders us perfect in 
    him and if he is perfected in us, purifying us from all spot and stain of 
    sin, he will present our soul to Christ like a beautiful bride, pure and 
    blameless. Then shall we rest in God, in his kingdom, and God will rest in 
    us through endless ages.</P>
    <P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
    <P align=justify>24. II, 46:3</P>
    <P align=justify>If a small child is unable to do anything for itself, 
    unable even to go towards its mother on its own feet, it will at least roll 
    itself over continually, weeping and crying as it searches for her. The 
    mother will have compassion on him, delighting to see her infant trying to 
    get to her with such a determined effort and so much anguish. Since the 
    child cannot go to her, it is she herself, because of the great longing he 
    has for her and because she too is constrained by love for him, who will 
    pick him up in her arms, utter endearments to him and tenderly nourish him. 
    </P>
    <P align=justify>God, who is our friend, acts in the same way towards the 
    soul who comes to him, burning with desire. More than that, impelled by his 
    deep love and the gracious goodness proper to his nature, he unites himself 
    closely with its understanding, becoming one spirit with it, as the Apostle 
    says. Indeed, if the soul clings to the Lord, and if the Lord, moved by love 
    and mercy, comes to unite himself closely with such a one willing to dwell 
    uninterruptedly in his grace, they will then become one spirit, being and 
    understanding fused in one.</P>
    <P align=justify>25. III, 27:4</P>
    <P align=justify>Those who have not advanced beyond the silliness of the 
    world remain a prey to passion; held in the grip of evil, they are incapable 
    of doing what they must to obtain life. If they experience distress and seek 
    God's help, bestir themselves for the sake of eternal life, with tears and 
    pleas call on their heavenly mother, the Holy Spirit; if they seek no solace 
    in the world and abide only in union with the Spirit and in their longing 
    for the nourishment she gives, that excellent heavenly mother will draw near 
    to these souls that seek her. She will lift them up in her life-giving arms, 
    warm them with the spiritual and heavenly food of delicious, desirable, 
    holy, pure milk, so that they will recognise the heavenly Father, and grow 
    each day into spiritual maturity until they arrive at the unity of the faith 
    and knowledge of the Son of God. </P>
    <P align=justify>26. II, 53:3</P>
    <P align=justify>In God's sight, it is not necessary to spend the entire day 
    on one's knees in prayer. Undoubtedly it is an excellent occupation; it is 
    really a good thing to pray and altogether to persevere in prayer. It heads 
    every other occupation in importance, but if not accompanied by the virtues 
    to be found in the other members, prayer is a dead thing. Prayer is pleasing 
    to God if accompanied by good works: not hating one's brother nor speaking 
    against anyone, being humble not superior, not thinking that we are 
    somebodies, but rather fulfilling all the works of justice. If we seek the 
    Lord thus in all sincerity and holiness, he will come to our assistance 
    without delay. If we do not seek him in this way, what we do will be 
    regarded as unsubstantial as a dream and our prayer being superficial will 
    avail nothing before God.</P>
    <P align=justify>27. II, 6:3</P>
    <P align=justify>The true basis of prayer is to keep guard over our 
    thoughts; we should carry it out in such great calm and peace as to give no 
    scandal to others. People will be edified by the one who has received the 
    grace of prayer from God and prays quietly to the end, "for God is not a God 
    of agitation, but of peace." Those given to loud cries during prayer behave 
    like coxswains shouting at the rowers to keep time; they cannot pray 
    everywhere, not in churches nor in the villages, perhaps only in the desert 
    can they do it as they like. Those on the other hand who pray quietly, no 
    matter where they may be, edify everybody. </P>
    <P align=justify>28. II, 31:2</P>
    <P align=justify>Let the soul collect and discipline, as one would unruly 
    children, the thoughts which sin has scattered far and wide; let it bring 
    them into the house of the body while it fasts and loves, waiting for the 
    Lord to come and give it the grace of true recollection.</P>
    <P align=justify>29. III, 16:8</P>
    <P align=justify>Let us then approach him, the gate that leads to life, and 
    knock that he may open unto us; let us ask to receive him, the Bread of 
    life. Let us say to him, "Lord, give me the Bread of life so that I may 
    live, because I am horribly racked by the pains of an evil hunger and am on 
    the way to perdition. Give me the lightsome garment of salvation to cover my 
    soul's shame, for I am naked, deprived of the power of your Spirit, and 
    ashamed of the indecency wrought by my passions." </P>
    <P align=justify>And if he says to you, "You had a garment, what have you 
    done with it?", answer him, "I fell among thieves who robbed and left me 
    half-dead, then they stripped me and took my garments... Give me the oil of 
    gladness and the wine of spiritual joy so that I may apply them to my wounds 
    and live again. Heal me, restore me to health, for my enemies, those fearful 
    robbers, have left me lying, half-dead." Happy the soul, needy and wounded 
    as it were, who prays tirelessly and ceaselessly, with perseverance and with 
    faith, for it will receive what it has asked for; it will obtain healing and 
    an eternal remedy and will be avenged of its enemies, the sinful passions. 
    God has promised it, and he is faithful. </P>
    <P align=justify>30. II, 33:4</P>
    <P align=justify>When the Lord sees that the soul musters its powers as well 
    as it can, that it seeks and watches for its Lord night and day and calls 
    upon him as he has commanded without ceasing, then shall he do what is right 
    by it, according to his promises. He will purify it of it sins and take it 
    to himself, a bride without spot or blemish. </P>
    <P align=justify>If you believe all this is true, as indeed it is, keep a 
    watch on yourself, see whether you have found your guiding light and the 
    true food and drink that is our Lord himself. If you have not found them, 
    seek them night and day. When you see the sun, think of seeking the true Sun 
    because of your blindness; When you see the light, turn your eyes towards 
    your own soul to see if you have found the good and true Light. For visible 
    things are a shadow of the true realities of the soul.</P>
    <P align=justify>31. II, 53:15</P>
    <P align=justify>By engaging in a struggle with his thoughts, a Christian 
    can arrive at such a degree of purification that he can turn whatever he 
    sees in the world to his own edification. He can think purely about 
    everything. Worldly riches and pleasures will make him think of true and 
    heavenly riches, of glory and unfading delights, of which those are but a 
    shadow. Indeed, this world is an image of the heavenly and eternal world. 
    </P>
    <P align=justify>Let us then turn to our advantage whatever we see within, 
    so that we do not give up meditating on the good, for it is possible 
    successfully to accomplish what is good through struggle, sweat and 
    spiritual travail. Indeed, God renders all things truly pure.</P>
    <P align=justify>32. II, 43:3</P>
    <P align=justify>The Christian must always keep in mind the thought of God. 
    Indeed, it is written, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your 
    heart." It is not only when trotting off to the chapel that he loves the 
    Lord. The thought of God still remains with him and he still loves him 
    tenderly just as well while walking, talking or eating. It is said, "Where 
    your heart is, there your treasure is also." In fact, that to which our 
    heart is attached, to which our desire draws us, that is our God. If your 
    heart ceaselessly desires God, he is the Lord of your heart. </P>
    <P align=justify>If after having professed renunciation and embraced 
    poverty, exile and fasting, a monk remains attached to himself, to the 
    things of this world, to his house, to love of his parents, he may have left 
    the world by the front door, but he has returned and falls back into it by a 
    concealed door.</P>
    <P align=justify>33. II, 8:1</P>
    <P align=justify>A person's heart may be filled with the power of God the 
    moment he has fallen to his knees. His soul rejoices in the Lord as a bride 
    in her husband, or as Isaiah says, "As a bridegroom rejoices in his bride, 
    so will the Lord rejoice over you." It can happen that, having spent the 
    whole day seeing to his duties, he gives himself for an hour to prayer. The 
    interior man is enraptured and gently transported to the infinite depths of 
    that other world, so much so that his mind is totally exiled from this one, 
    raised up and ravished to the heights. At moments like these, he completely 
    forgets his earthly concerns; he is filled and held by thoughts which bear 
    him towards divine, heavenly, infinite and inconceivable realities, towards 
    marvels human lips may not utter. Such is the experience, that he would fain 
    ask that his soul might depart from this life during this moment of 
    prayer.</P>
    <P align=justify>34. II, 17:4</P>
    <P align=justify>Those who even now are enraptured and transported to the 
    world to come contemplate its beauty and its wonders. We are still on the 
    earth, but "our homeland is in heaven"; as far as the mind, the interior 
    man, is concerned, we live and dwell in that other world. Just as the 
    physical eye, if it is healthy, always sees the sun clearly, so the 
    perfectly purified spirit sees the radiant glory of Christ continually; it 
    is with the Lord day and night just as the body of the Lord, united to the 
    divinity, is always with the Holy Spirit. </P>
    <P align=justify>However, people do not reach this stage in a moment; they 
    do so through many trials, tribulations and struggles. There are some of 
    them in whom grace and evil dwell and abide at the same time: two kinds of 
    citizenship, one of light and the other of darkness, both exercise their 
    influence on the heart.</P>
    <P align=justify>35. II, 10:1</P>
    <P align=justify>Those lovers of truth and of God who, fired by a great 
    hope, long to put on Christ, do not really need the guidance of others. They 
    cannot bear, even for a single moment, to be without their heavenly desire 
    and impassioned love of our Lord. Being completely and unreservedly nailed 
    to the cross of Christ, they sense they are progressing spiritually day by 
    day towards the nuptial chamber. Smitten by the desire of heaven, athirst 
    for righteousness and all the virtues, they are consumed by an ardent and 
    insatiable desire for the illumination of the Holy Spirit. Even if, because 
    of the grace of their faith, they be judged worthy of understanding the 
    divine mysteries, of sharing in the joy of heaven, they still place no trust 
    in themselves and do not imagine that they are somebodies. On the contrary, 
    the more spiritual gifts they receive, the more insatiable their desire for 
    heaven, the more ardent their thirst for God. The more they discern 
    spiritual progress in themselves, the more hunger and thirst they have to 
    receive grace and grow in it. The more richly endowed they are spiritually, 
    the more they think themselves poor, for their spiritual desire for their 
    heavenly Spouse has become insatiable.</P>
    <P align=justify>36. II, 10:4</P>
    <P align=justify>The true lover of God and of Christ, were he to accomplish 
    ten thousand acts of righteousness, would consider himself to have done 
    nothing at all, so insatiable is his desire for God. Even if he had worn out 
    his body with fasting and vigils, he would act as if had not yet begun his 
    toilsome pursuit of virtue. In spite of the various gifts of the Spirit, the 
    revelations and the heavenly mysteries of which he has been deemed worthy, 
    he is conscious, in his limitless and insatiable love of the Lord, of not 
    having done anything yet. Throughout the day, he experiences hunger and 
    thirst in his great faith and love, and he perseveres in prayer, insatiable 
    when it comes to the mysteries of grace and the acquisition of virtue.</P>
    <P align=justify>His soul is smitten by the impassioned love poured into him 
    by the heavenly Spirit, who continually awakens in him by the action of his 
    grace, a burning desire for his heavenly Spouse. This desire urges him to 
    aspire to the mysterious and indescribable communion with him in its 
    fullness, through the sanctifying action of the Spirit. The countenance of 
    the soul is unveiled and, face to face with his heavenly Spouse, it fixes 
    his eyes on him in a spiritual, inexpressible light. The soul becomes one 
    thing with Christ in unshakeable faith. Conformed to his death, she looks 
    forward avidly and ceaselessly to death for his sake and in the invincible 
    hope that the Spirit will free her completely from darksome passion and from 
    sin.</P>
    <P align=justify>Then, purified by the Spirit, holy in body and soul, he is 
    judged worthy of becoming a pure vessel, able to contain heavenly perfume 
    and to receive the true King, Christ himself. He is now rendered worthy of 
    eternal life, having become even in this life a pure dwelling-place of the 
    Holy Spirit.</P></FONT><FONT color=#ff0000 size=5>

    <P align=justify>EXPLANATION </P>
    <P align=justify>OF THE TEXTS</P></B></FONT><FONT color=#7f7f7f>
    <P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
    <P align=justify>1. </P>
    <P align=justify>We have here, then, the word "Brother" to designate the 
    monk. Macarius often uses the word "Christian", since the monk takes the 
    Christian life seriously and tries to live it to perfection, e.g. Homily II, 
    5, the outline of which will be found on the third page of the course, is 
    addressed to the Christian who has left the world. Which does not mean it 
    should not be an ideal for the Christian in the world! </P>
    <P align=justify>Note the sense of fraternal charity and of the unity of all 
    in the one body, the Body of Christ, which this text exemplifies.</P>
    <P align=justify>2.</P><I>
    <P align=justify>&lt;</I>Atony' is a term very close to acedia, and indeed 
    is a result of acedia: acedia = breaking off of the relationship with God 
    and so the forfeiture of grace and of divine succour. The result is a loss 
    of spiritual tone (<I>a-tony</I>).</P>
    <P align=justify>Grace returns when one comes back to God through prayer and 
    supplication. An important theme in Macarius: cf. further on, the comparison 
    with a small child who can do nothing but cry to his mother.</P>
    <P align=justify>At the end, the mention of vigilance, nepsis.</P>
    <P align=justify>3.</P>
    <P align=justify>"So that man may become a twofold being" refers to the 
    notion of the exterior man and the interior man, the earthly man and the 
    heavenly man. It is summed up in Homily II,15:22: "If a person loves God, 
    God's love becomes part of him. Once a man has believed in him, God endows 
    him with heavenly faith as well, and man becomes a twofold being." And 
    again, "The Lord thought it well for the Christian to have two souls, one 
    created, and the other heavenly coming from the divine Spirit." (52:5). The 
    idea recurs in the following text (4).</P>
    <P align=justify>5.</P>
    <P align=justify>The kinship of the soul with God, due to the fact that 
    alone among creatures, man has been "created in the image and likeness of 
    God", implies that he must seek him, his final end.</P>
    <P align=justify>7.</P>
    <P align=justify>Temptation comes when one listens willingly to the word of 
    Satan. However, one remains free. It is when man welcomes it into his heart 
    and allows it to penetrate him through and through that he commits sin and 
    so is reduced to slavery and become subject to death.</P>
    <P align=justify>11.</P>
    <P align=justify>Mention of the "thought of God", trusting in him, which 
    helps in the struggle against thoughts.</P>
    <P align=justify>13.</P>
    <P align=justify>For Macarius, the spiritual life has two phases. First 
    there is the active, even wilful, phase in which the brother must fight the 
    spiritual fight, thus proving to God that he is really seeking him. But when 
    we have abandoned our will to God, and given proof of our desire for him by 
    our perseverance, God himself intervenes and gives us what our efforts have 
    been unable to bring about: true prayer, true love, true meekness.</P>
    <P align=justify>This idea also lies behind Texts 18 and 23.</P>
    <P align=justify>19.</P>
    <P align=justify>Macarius takes up an Origenist idea, according to which, 
    God alone is incorporeal. All other creatures, being created, have either a 
    material body, like man, or a "subtle", "ethereal" body. Macarius compares 
    the way in which the soul, a "subtle" body, is united to our earthly body 
    and that in which God, who is incorporeal, is united to holy souls by means 
    of the Incarnation.</P>
    <P align=justify>23.</P>
    <P align=justify>The rest in question is rest in God, the reward of 
    humility, promised by Jesus: "Learn of me because I am meek and humble of 
    heart, and you will find rest for your souls." The soul recognises that it 
    is dependent on a God who is love. This rest will find its fulfilment in the 
    vision of heaven. As God is rest, he will rest in us just as we shall rest 
    in him.</P>
    <P align=justify>But Macarius also recognises an evil rest in which the soul 
    fails to recognise its real benefactor and rests in the goods of this world 
    (II,45:3). Those who know the rest given through grace reject rest in the 
    pleasures of the world.</P>
    <P align=justify>24.</P>
    <P align=justify>Here we have a passage in Macarius, and not the only one, 
    in which we find the teaching of the 'little way' of St. Therese of Lisieux. 
    It is our weakness which most moves the heart of God. If in the spiritual 
    life, our efforts seem unfruitful, we can always cry to God, plead our 
    helplessness and beg his help. </P>
    <P align=justify>We can see here the importance of grace for Macarius, who 
    has sometimes been accused of semi-pelagianism! Grace is the expression of 
    the motherhood of God, as the following text shows even more clearly.</P>
    <P align=justify>26.</P>
    <P align=justify>Macarius' thought is very balanced: he upholds the 
    importance of prayer, but this is no more than a day-dream without good 
    works. </P>
    <P align=justify>34.</P>
    <P align=justify>This is the theologia of Evagrius, but more concretely 
    expressed by someone who has lived it._</P>

    <P align=justify>ANSWERS</P></B></FONT><FONT color=#7f7f7f>
    <P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
    <P align=justify>1) Why do we speak of 'Pseudo'-Macarius? Who was he?</P>
    <P align=justify><I>We speak of 'Pseudo' (= false) Macarius because the 
    person hidden under this name is not, as was once thought, Macarius the 
    Great, founder of Scete. He was a spiritual writer who lived in the region 
    of Mesopotamia and had contacts with Messalianism. </P></I>
    <P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
    <P align=justify>2) What are the characteristic features of his 
    doctrine?</P><I>
    <P align=justify>He places great emphasis on evil, whence the need for the 
    spiritual combat. He also greatly stresses prayer directed to Christ and to 
    the Spirit. He gives a central position to the Holy Spirit.</P></I>
    <P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
    <P align=justify>3) What is the context of this doctrine? </P><I>
    <P align=justify>The context is a loosely cenobitic framework. </P></I>
    <P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
    <P align=justify>4) Note the main features of his anthropology.</P><I>
    <P align=justify>Man is composed of body, soul and spirit, which is the 
    ancient threefold division. He is created in the image and likeness of God, 
    which makes him akin to God. Man fell but Christ came to restore his dignity 
    to him. We have to collaborate in the work of salvation.</P></I>
    <P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
    <P align=justify>5) Which virtue, among the others, does he most 
    emphasise?</P><I>
    <P align=justify>He greatly emphasises humility, the mark of the 
    Christian.</P></I>
    <P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
    <P align=justify>6) What is special to him in his teaching on the Holy 
    Spirit? </P><I>
    <P align=justify>Macarius gives all sorts of titles to the Holy Spirit. He 
    shows that he is a good friend of man. Better, he presents him as a 
    Mother.</P></I>
    <P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
    <P align=justify>7) What is the place of the Holy Spirit in prayer?</P><I>
    <P align=justify>It is he that teaches us true prayer. He collects our 
    scattered thoughts and comes to pray in us.</P></I>
