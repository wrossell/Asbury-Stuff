<P>A Testimony to Christianity as Transfiguration: The Macarian Homilies and 
Orthodox Spirituality</P>
<P><I>Given at the Conference on Orthodox and Wesleyan Spirituality, St. 
Vladimir's Seminary, </P>
<P>January, 1999, and published in </I>Orthodox and Wesleyan Spirituality<I>, 
ed. S. T. Kimbrough</P></I>
<P><I>(Crestwood NY:2002) 129-156.</P></I>
<P>It is an honor and pleasure for me to be here today at a conference which 
features the names of so many scholars who are either acquaintances of some 
years' standing, or else whose works I have long admired without the benefit of 
personal encounter. I must also confess a certain sense of inadequacy. I am not 
at all familiar with one half of our theme, that of Methodist spirituality, and 
am consequently obliged to take refuge in the hope that the nature of my subject 
will at least serve to provide some material for further thought and discussion. 
Kallistos Ware, for instance, begins his "Preface" to the recent, Paulist Press 
edition of <U>The Fifty Spiritual Homilies</U> with a quotation from John 
Wesley, "I have read Macarius and my heart sang", while Ernst Benz and Herman 
Doerries wrote some years ago on Macarian influences in, respectively, 
Anglo-Saxon Protestant thought and continental Pietism [1]. So it is at least 
clear that others have felt that my author does supply a number of points of 
contact between the Christian East and the later, post-Reformation West.</P>
<P>Given my limitations, I am obliged to focus on "Macarius" himself, with an 
eye perhaps toward pointing on occasion to his relationship with and influence 
on certain central themes, or, to borrow an expression from Jaroslav Pelikan, 
"melodies" within the harmonies and, once in a while, disharmonies of the 
theological and ascetico-mystical tradition in the Orthodox East [2] -- thus, 
for example, the "transfiguration" of this paper's title. I could as easily have 
said "transformation" or "deification", or else, particularly given the two 
traditions meeting here this week, "holiness" or "sanctification", since I take 
the transfiguration of my title as inclusive for "Macarius" of all of these. To 
touch briefly on some of the points to follow, he understands Christianity as 
the renewal of the human being. God in Christ has entered into our world and, in 
baptism, into the Christian's body and soul. The latter is thus, in potential, 
the royal throne of Christ (a note I shall come back to in detail below), and to 
work toward the conscious fulfillment of that potential, that is, to a loving 
awareness and even perhaps vision of the indwelling glory of Christ in the 
Spirit, is the whole aim of Christian life on this side of the eschaton. Hope 
and longing for that encounter engage one in a total effort of moral and 
psychological reform, an effort which, once committed to, reveals in its turn 
the limitations of any purely human effort, and so the necessity of grace to 
overcome the force of sin rooted in the soul. Humility, thus, and constant 
prayer provide the necessary ground for that stress on the visitation of grace 
for which the <U>Macariana</U> are primarily known: the light-filled experience 
(<U>peira</U>) of the divine presence "perceptibly and with complete assurance" 
(<U>en pasei aisthesei kai plerophoriai</U>) [3]. This program was not without 
controversy, but by way of arriving at that discussion perhaps we should have a 
look first at "Macarius" himself, at least as much as can be known about him, 
together with a few more details of his thought.</P>
<P>The <U>Macarian Homilies</U> were written in Greek at the end of the fourth 
century, but we do not have any exemplars in that language earlier than four 
medieval Byzantine collections, of which three (including the best known 
<U>Fifty Spiritual Homilies</U>) exist in critical editions [4]. We do not know, 
moreover, who the author of the Macarian Homilies was. He was certainly not 
Macarius the Great of Egypt, though it was under the latter's name that his 
writings were eventually to find a safe haven [5]. In this respect, our 
anonymous author has much in common with another late fourth century, monastic 
writer, Evagrius of Pontus (+399), several of whose works were also handed down 
under the protection of someone else's name [6]. In each case the pseudonymity 
was a posthumous device, and likely a necessary one, since both writers were 
controversial and even judged (if not always accurately or fairly, particularly 
in our writer's case) to have been heretical. In spite of those condemnations, 
Evagrius and Macarius -- to give our author the name he has gone by for 
centuries -- can fairly be called the most influential of the fourth century 
monastic writers. So influential, in fact, that it is no exaggeration to say 
that together they gave to the spirituality of the Christian East the shape 
which it has held to the present day. "Evagrius", in the words of a contemporary 
scholar who reflects the modern academic consensus, "established the categories; 
Macarius ...provided the affective content". </P>
<P>While I am myself not entirely happy with casting Evagrius as the mystic of 
the head and Macarius as the avatar of mystical <U>Gefuehl</U>, I will admit 
that there is considerable justice to seeing the works of the two men as 
"mutually corrective and complementary" [7]. Evagrius is the theoretician, often 
(though not always) cool and even remote in tone, whose preferred diction 
features the brief, dense and highly allusive sentences which he adapted from 
the style of biblical wisdom literature and contemporary, Cynic discourse, and 
which he intended his disciples and other readers to ponder slowly in the 
solitude of their desert hermitages [8]. Macarius, though he is also clearly a 
monastic <U>geron</U> or <U>staretz</U>, a charismatic and inspired elder 
charged with the guidance of souls, is much more the preacher intent on 
encouraging, exhorting, warning, and persuading [9]. His language in consequence 
is open and immediately accessible, flooded with imagery borrowed from the 
scriptures, contemporary society, and the natural world. He is also, unlike 
Evagrius in the latter's retreat in Egypt's empty wastes, fully immersed in the 
life of his own and related communities in the heavily populated regions of 
upper Mesopotamia (or southern Asia Minor), laying down a rule for his spiritual 
children, engaging in question and answer sessions with his own and other monks, 
sometimes fighting with the local hierarchy, defending himself and his 
followers, arguing for his understanding of the faith, and correcting other 
ascetics whose thinking and behavior he believes has strayed from the ways of 
Christian life and into demonic delusions [10]. Macarius is, in addition, 
clearly a man in whom several different Christian (and even pre-Christian) 
currents of tradition converge. He shares with Evagrius in his debts to the 
Christian Platonism of Alexandria through Clement and especially Origen, and -- 
as appears increasingly clear -- in personal ties with the Cappadocian Fathers, 
but he combines with these connections the different, Syrian Christian currents 
represented by Aphrahat and Ephrem, by the likewise anonymous and ascetic work 
called the <U>Book of Steps</U> or <U>Liber Graduum</U>, and by the encratism of 
the Thomas tradition and of the wandering Manichaean ascetics, together with 
elements from Jewish and Jewish-Christian apocalyptic and related literature 
[11]. Yet Evagrius may himself also, less the specifically Syrian element, have 
been aware of and responding to lines of biblical exegesis related to 
apocalyptic and rabbinical thought [12]. All in all, the differences in style, 
personality, and background are real enough, but do not point necessarily to the 
head versus heart distinction so favored by modern scholarship ever since Irenee 
Hausherr's famous article sixty years ago delineating the purported "schools" of 
Eastern Christian spirituality, according to which schema Evagrius represented 
the "school of intellect" and Macarius that of "feeling"; a taxonomy which is 
not a little -- and, to my mind, suspiciously -- reminiscent of the 
"intellective" and "affective" labels long applied to such Western Medieval 
writers as, say, Eckhardt and other Dominican Rhinelanders, on the one hand, and 
Bernard, together perhaps with the Franciscans, on the other [13].</P>
<P>One area where we can speak of a certain real difference in the doctrines 
which the two men teach concerns the ultimate role and eschatological destiny of 
the body. Put simply, for Evagrius the body has no role in the world to come 
while for Macarius it does. Both men teach an assimilation to the presence and 
activity of the living God, and both teach the vision of God as light, but 
Evagrius has no place for the transformation or transfiguration of the body 
[14]. The latter, together with the lower faculties of the soul, are for him 
providential and necessary, but, rather like booster rockets in a space-shuttle 
launch, are to be jettisoned once their purpose has been performed. They propel 
the initial phase of the ascent -- or return -- to God [15]. Macarius, though 
certainly also a Platonist and devoted to the allegorizing exegesis of Christian 
Alexandria, remains too firmly rooted in biblical realism to dispense with the 
body's share in the Kingdom of Heaven. Rather than an ultimately disembodied 
spirit (or <U>nous</U>), as in Evagrius, he sees the transfigured human being at 
the eschaton as one in whom the illumined and glorified soul shares its splendor 
and light with the risen body. The Gospel account of Christ's Transfiguration on 
Mt. Thabor serves as the image and promise both of the <U>visio dei</U> accorded 
the soul in this life, and of the eschatological transformation of soul and 
body: "Just as when the Lord had ascended the mountain He 'was transfigured' 
into His divine glory, so are there souls which even in the present time are 
illumined and glorified with Him, while on the last day their bodies as well 
will be glorified and flashing with light" (I.18.7.3). What is visible to the 
eyes of the illumined soul now and within, that is, the abiding and glory of 
Christ and the Spirit in the "inner man", will then become visible outside, in 
the very limbs of the transformed body [16]. </P>
<P>Macarius' thought turns constantly around this duality or tension of "inner" 
and "outer", and it is always the former to which he accords priority. He uses a 
number of different words for it: heart, soul, <U>nous</U> or intellect, and, 
after the usage of St. Paul (and of Origen!), "inner man". Very occasionally he 
distinguishes among them, as for example when he speaks of the <U>nous</U> as 
the "eye" of the heart or soul, but more often he appears to employ them 
interchangeably as rough equivalents. The characterization of his thought as a 
mysticism of "the heart", at least in so far as heart is understood as denoting 
a primarily emotive or affective emphasis, strikes me therefore as misleading, 
or at least as one sided [17]. What he is concerned with first and foremost is 
the inner life where emotions, appetites, thought, and will all have their 
place, and perhaps most especially the will, the <U>autexousion</U> or capacity 
for self-determination [18]. It is the inner life of the human being, after all, 
which for him is first and most radically affected by the original Fall. It is 
there, within the soul, that Satan and his angels have set up their dwellings 
and palaces amid the cloud or, to use Macarius' own favored phrase, the "veil" 
of disordered drives and appetites which he covers with the term, "passions". 
The veil of the passions brought about by Adam's Fall and the devil's 
inhabitation prevent communion and conversation with God [19]. They block the 
vision of and share in divine glory that was Adam's original inheritance, his 
royal "robe" and "crown".</P>
<P>The robe and crown of divine glory are ancient themes in Jewish and Syrian 
Christian literature [20]. So is the language of the warfare between God and 
devil, light and dark, and of the"two ways" which Macarius also draws on in 
order to describe the post-lapsarian, human condition [21]. Stripped of 
participation in divine glory and life, naked in its own inadequacy, humanity is 
in a state of constant conflict in a disordered and perishing world. Though the 
power of self-determination, the capacity to choose the right and refuse the 
evil, never departs us (Macarius is the heir of such as Ephrem Syrus as much as 
of Origen in his refusal to accept fatalism of any kind), the cure for our 
condition is beyond our powers. We can of our own volition neither remove the 
veil that the evil one has wrapped around us, nor heal what Macarius calls the 
"incurable passions" (<U>ta aniata pathe</U>), nor dry up the "bubbling spring" 
of evil impulses which lies in the deeps of the heart or soul [22]. More 
powerfully and realistically, I think, than Evagrius, our Syrian Christian 
ascetic is aware of the power of evil. He is, though, marginally more optimistic 
than an Augustine. He believes that the human being can refuse to <U>do</U> what 
is sin<U>ful</U>. The acts of the body are largely within our control. What we 
cannot do, in his view, is rid ourselves of sin within the soul, of the 
condition that renders us opaque to the vision and indwelling of God. In regard 
to the healing of the inner life, all that the human being can do is cry out for 
divine help [23].</P>
<P>So it is for God to act on our behalf in order to cure and to restore. 
Macarius' Christology is entirely orthodox and traditionally Eastern -- if I may 
speak so broadly -- in its emphasis on the ontological effects of the Word of 
God's incarnation, death, and resurrection. <U>Theosis</U>, deification, is 
quite as much the point of Christ's saving action for Macarius as it is for 
Athanasius, for Basil the Great, or for Ephrem Syrus [24]. Perhaps, though, we 
find somewhat more emphasis in his writings on Christ as precisely healer or 
physician, <U>iatros</U>, of the soul than we do in other Greek writers. The 
Lord as <U>osyo</U>, healer, is a very ancient and popular Syrian Christian 
theme, though certainly not absent in other early Christian writers [25]. In any 
case, it is only in and through Christ dwelling within the soul in the power of 
the Holy Spirit that the wellsprings of evil can be dried up, the veil removed, 
that we may be transfigured "from glory to glory" through looking on the "light 
of the face of Christ within the heart". </P>
<P>The allusion just now to St. Paul, specifically to I Corinthians 3:7-4:6, is 
deliberate. I might even venture to suggest that the whole Macarian corpus 
comprises a kind of extended meditation on this scriptural passage. Macarius 
seems to understand it as encapsulating virtually all the essentials of what he 
has to say to his monks [26]. It includes the contrasts between the Old and New 
Covenants, between veiled and unveiled, between outward and inward, between body 
and soul, and between Moses as type of the salvation to come and Christ and the 
Spirit as its fulfillment. Even more, it speaks of the change, alteration, or 
transfiguration -- <U>metabole</U>, <U>alloiosis</U>, <U>metamorphosis</U> -- 
which occurs in the Christian soul through the indwelling Spirit, and of the 
glory (<U>doxa</U>) of God in which the soul and ultimately the body are called 
to share. Finally, there is the overlap, I might say, between Christ and the 
Holy Spirit which is also a feature of the <U>Homilies</U>. All of these notes 
occur repeatedly in the <U>Homilies</U>. The obedience enjoined by the Law was 
an outward thing whereas, Macarius observes, in Christianity "everything is 
within (<U>endon</U>)" [27]. The whole of Israel's sacred history, of God's 
relations with His chosen people, becomes thus for the Christian the story of 
the soul's relation with Christ [28]. </P>
<P>The echo of Alexandrian spiritual exegesis from Philo through Origen, 
mediated in Macarius' case perhaps especially through Gregory of Nyssa, is 
surely unmistakeable. I should like, though, to underline what I take to be the 
<U>Homilies</U>' particular emphasis on the Old Testamental motifs of the 
promised land and holy city, Jerusalem, and of the tabernacle and temple as the 
place of God's abiding. Christ is the reality of these images. He is the 
heavenly fatherland and the celestial city, the place of God's presence and -- 
to borrow an expression from the Targumim, since I think the traditions the 
latter represent are close to Macarius' own heart -- the "glory of the 
<U>Shekinah</U>" which dwells there and fills all with light [29]. This presence 
or abiding, the literal sense of <U>Shekinah</U>, which comes to the Christian 
through baptism and the gift of the Holy Spirit, renders the soul in its turn 
the city and temple of God, at least in potential [30]. Here we arrive at once 
at the place of the ascetical life for Macarius, and at the question of the 
Church's sacraments and their relation to his thought. I will begin with the 
first: ascesis as the action of the body and soul, cooperating with divine 
grace, in order to ascend the inner Sinai and arrive at the conscious 
perception, and even the vision, of the Presence Who, even now, awaits the 
believer within the latter's heart of hearts, in its innermost recesses, at the 
sanctuary and altar of the soul. </P>
<P>Cooperation, <U>synergia</U>, is certainly a key term for Macarius, as it is 
for the Eastern Christian tradition generally [31]. If true healing and ultimate 
transformation come about only through the power of God, the human will is still 
required to contribute its part. Testing and trials are of the essence of being 
a Christian. We are called patiently to endure sufferings, and thereby to 
imitate the passion and death of Christ. Macarius returns again and again to 
this theme in his answers and sermons to his monks. Never, he insists, is the 
Christian -- a term which he uses, in the fashion of Basil the Great, as more or 
less synonymous with, and even preferable to, "monk" or "solitary" 
(<U>monazon</U>) -- going to be without trials in this life [32]. There is no 
security here below. All is struggle, though by God's mercy the glory and 
splendor of heaven may occcasionally be glimpsed. Furthermore, as one of his 
homilies puts it: </P></FONT><FONT size=1>
<P>The warfare is...double for Christians...For after someone [i.e., a monk] has 
withdrawn from parents, spouse, possessions, comfort, fatherland, and 
customs....then, when he has gathered himself together and is concentrating </P>
<P>on the Lord, and after he has so to speak pried open the inside of his soul, 
he</P>
<P>faces another war, a great battle against opposing powers, against invisible 
</P>
<P>enemies and the activities of darkness, against which he is obliged to take 
up</P>
<P>heavenly armor in order to be able to emerge 
victorious...[33]</P></FONT><FONT size=2>
<P>This battle, he continues, is "inside, in the soul, in the thoughts" [34]. 
The inner and deeper warfare requires divine assistance, precisely the "heavenly 
armor" mentioned above and borrowed from Ephesians 6:14-17. Heavenly aid begins 
and ends with love, the yearning desire for Christ which is at once the 
expression of the soul's own deepest longings and, simultaneously, the Lord's 
gift and presence. Like Origen and Gregory of Nyssa, Macarius uses <U>eros</U> 
and <U>agape</U> effectively as synonyms [35]. They express at bottom the 
dynamism of both the Creator-Redeemer, and of the created human being in process 
of redemption and, for Gregory and Macarius together in conscious opposition to 
Origen, in the everlasting growth of beatitude [36]. If love is the alpha and 
omega of the virtues, in between come the others: faith, repentance, hope, 
endurance, patience, long-suffering, meekness, humility, dispassion 
(<U>apatheia</U>), and, beginning as willed activity and ending as divine gift, 
perseverance in prayer [37]. </P>
<P>The emphasis on prayer will surely remind us of Evagrius, as must Macarius' 
insistence on the mutually supporting chain of the virtues, his emphasis on the 
battle with the "thoughts", <U>logismoi</U>, and the value he accords 
dispassion. There are, just as clearly, important differences. First, there is 
next to none of Evagrius' careful effort to systematize these elements, most of 
them held in common virtually throughout the more learned monastic literature of 
the day, and arrange them into a precisely articulated pedagogy of the soul 
[38]. Again, we find here the contrast between the theoretician and the 
preacher. Second, certain of Macarius' emphases are typical of the specifically 
Syrian asceticism of his day and long afterwards. At this point we arrive at the 
matter of his alleged "heresy": the monastic movement or, perhaps better, bundle 
of ascetical beliefs and tendencies which the church hierarchy of Syria and Asia 
Minor condemned in a series of councils at the end of the fourth and beginning 
of the fifth centuries under the label of "messalianism". The word comes from 
the Syriac "to pray" (<U>tslo</U>, hence the participle, <U>metsalyane</U>, the 
"praying ones"), and it was the bishops' contention that these monks' emphasis 
on prayer and dispassion had led them into error. For our purposes here, we may 
single out the accusations that the monks claimed that human beings are entirely 
subjected to the devil, that the latter's presence within the soul could not be 
eradicated by Baptism, but only by prayer and by the subsequent indwelling of 
the Spirit which, once given, assured a permanent state of dispassion and 
freedom from sin. Together with these charges, we also find the assertion that 
these ascetics claimed a vision of the Holy Spirit, indeed, even of the Trinity, 
with their bodily eyes [39]. Now, it is beyond doubt that certain of these 
propositions were culled from the <U>Macarian Homilies</U>, in particular the 
co-indwelling of the sin and grace even after Baptism, insistence on the 
importance of prayer, and -- though only in a falsified way where the texts were 
clearly taken out of context -- in the possibility and experience of divine 
light [40]. </P>
<P>While there may doubtless have been individuals and even groups who espoused 
the extremes these condemnations describe, it is also the case that Macarius 
himself was, on the one hand, struggling against certain of these ideas -- at 
least in their cruder form --among his monks, and, on the other hand, that both 
he and they were heirs of long-standing elements in Syrian, particularly 
Syriac-speaking Christianity. Here I have especially in mind the twin emphases 
on asceticism and pneumatology, together with a frankly visionary element, so 
prominent in, for example, the <U>Acts of Thomas</U>, which are as well to the 
fore in such later and more "orthodox" fourth century writers as Aphrahat and (a 
little more controversially) the <U>Liber Graduum</U>, and which at the same 
time draw on ancient currents dating from Second Temple Judaism, notably the 
literature of apocalyptic [41]. As one recent scholar remarked, with perhaps a 
little exaggeration: "Messalianism is originally no more and no less than an 
obvious irruption of Syrian Christianity, and it could have been taken as 
heterodox only from the narrow perspective of an imperial orthodoxy" [42]. 
Somewhat less fiercely, Columba Stewart has convincingly demonstrated that much 
of the Messalian controversy derived from what amounted to a kind of culture 
clash: Greek-speaking bishops confronted with, and reacting without either much 
sympathy or comprehension to a phenomenon and vocabulary whose origins lay in 
the Semitic earth of Syria-Palestine [43]. Macarius, we might say, was caught in 
the middle and branded quite undiscrimatingly with the same stigma that was 
attached with a trifle more justice to some of his more extreme countrymen. We 
have to thank those early generations of monks, wiser in at least this regard 
than their bishops, who sheltered the <U>Homilies</U> under the protective cover 
of a famous and uncontroversial name for the fact that these invaluable texts 
survived at all -- and, indeed, more than survived, since they have continued to 
nourish and influence both Eastern and, later on, Western Christians to the 
present day.</P>
<P>To speak of Macarius as a man in the middle is apt in a couple of ways. He 
is, as I have noted, someone who stands at the confluence of several different 
currents of Christian thought and tradition, though to what degree he is doing 
so consciously I will leave for others to determine. He is also, however, on 
occasion and very consciously facing in two directions at once: toward his 
monks, whom he is trying to guide and whose enthusiasms he is often seeking to 
temper and direct, and toward the bishops and other church authorities whose 
concerns for the sacramental and doctrinal integrity of the Church he is seeking 
to satisfy while at the same time defending as vigorously as he can, and often 
rather sharply, those elements of faith and practice which the heresiologists 
have fingered as doctrinal error, most notably the certainty which he shares 
with his monks that it is possible to experience and even -- if only momentarily 
-- to see God while still in this present life [44]. Regarding, for example, the 
debate around the Trinity which so preoccupied the fourth century, he is careful 
to include a confession of faith at the beginning of his <U>Great Letter</U>, 
otherwise devoted to setting out a community rule for his monks, which both 
precisely reflects the trinitarian settlement following the Council of 
Constantinople in AD 381 and insists on his faith in the "one baptism" of the 
Church [45]. Elsewhere in his works we can pick out strains of anti-Eunomian 
polemic that recall the controversial works of Basil the Great and Gregory of 
Nyssa [46]. In the space remaining to me, however I would like to focus on what 
Macarius has to say both about the <U>visio dei</U><I>,</I> and about the 
relation which the Church's sacraments and, more generally, the liturgical 
assembly have with the life of the "inner man". What he wrote with respect to 
both would have great influence in subsequent Eastern Christian tradition. Let 
me begin with the first, the matter of vision.</P>
<P>There is no questions that visions of heavenly things were much on the mind 
of Macarius' monks. Consider, for example, the following 
exchange:</P></FONT><I><FONT size=1>
<P>Question: </I>What should one do who is led astray by Satan through, for 
example, an </P>
<P>appearance of blessedness, or else by what seems to be a revelation of grace 
in light?</P><I>
<P>Answer: </I>One needs a great deal of discernment for this in order to 
recognize and understand</P>
<P>the exact difference between good and evil...So, too, should you receive even 
heavenly beings</P>
<P>with careful testing, knowledge, and discernment...[47]</P></FONT><FONT 
size=2>
<P>Even angels are to be asked for their credentials and not accepted until 
after a careful perusal. On the other hand, it is evident that both Macarius and 
his interlocutor took for granted the possibility of such visitations. The chief 
criterion for distinguishing the true from the false light is the effect it has 
on the recipient. The reply thus continues:</P></FONT><FONT size=1>
<P>...even if, wishing to deceive the soul, he [Satan] were to create fantasies 
by transforming</P>
<P>himself into brilliant visions...he is unable to effect love in you for 
either God or for the </P>
<P>brethren without immediately causing conceit and arrogance. Nor can he bring 
humility, </P>
<P>nor joy, nor peace, nor quieting of the thoughts, nor hatred of the world, 
nor rest in God, nor</P>
<P>desire for the good things of heaven...All these things are the results of 
grace...It is therefore</P>
<P>from its activity within you that you are to know whether the intelligible 
light that has shone</P>
<P>in your soul is of God or of Satan. [48]</P></FONT><FONT size=2>
<P>Moreover, he concludes, the experienced soul should be able to differentiate 
between "the gifts of the Spirit and the phantasms of Satan" by virtue of its 
"spiritual perception" [<U>aisthesis</U>], just as "the throat knows the 
difference" between wine and vinegar. They look alike, but their taste 
distinguishes them immediately [49].</P>
<P>I should like to underline three things about this passage. There is , first, 
the insistence that the virtues, in particular love of God and neighbor, 
necessarily accompany any true visitation, and, as a kind of corollary, the 
implication that these virtues are not necessarily accompanied by vision. They 
stand, therefore, as in a sense primary, which is to say that the Christian 
experience of grace is not necessarily visionary, a matter of extraordinary 
experiences [50]. Second, the "spiritual perception" of which Macarius speaks 
recalls the "spiritual senses" of Origen and, again, it is this perception, 
broader than simply vision and itself the fruit of the experience of grace, 
together with its accompanying discernment, which he appears to hold out to his 
interlocutor as of more lasting importance for the spiritual life than vision 
<U>per se</U> [51]. Third, however, he is convinced that an experience of God in 
the form of a vision of light within the soul is not only possible, but -- and 
here I add to the passage cited above -- a foretaste of the eschatological 
transformation to come. This conviction doubtless derives in great part from his 
own experience. In the best known of the several Macarian collections, 
Collection II or the <U>Fifty Spiritual Homilies</U>, the eighth homily lists in 
the third person a series of visions, including a "cross of light" plunging 
itself "deep into the inner man", a "splendid robe...not made by human hands" 
like the clothes of Christ on the mount of the Transfiguration, and finally, 
citing from George Maloney's recent translation:</P></FONT><FONT size=1>
<P>Sometimes indeed the very light itself, shining in theheart, opened up 
interiorly and in a</P>
<P>profound way a hidden light, so that the whole person was completely drowned 
with that</P>
<P>sweet contemplation...[52]</P></FONT><FONT size=2>
<P>Later on in the same homiliy, in an exceptionally rare instance of the 
autobiographical in Greek patristic literature, he makes it clear that he was 
himself the subject of these experiences: "After I received the sign of the 
cross...grace quiets all my parts and my heart" [53]. Elsewhere he is emphatic 
that this light of grace is not a human or created thing [54]. In the following 
citation from Collection I, for example, he takes issue with what appear to be 
critics of visionary experience. Against their claim that any experience of 
light is to be understood as metaphorical, or perhaps as intellectual, that is, 
as a kind of mental illumination or flash of insight that may come as from 
studying the scriptures, Macarius opposes scriptural acccounts of a <U>visio 
luminae</U>, including Paul's conversion on the Damascus Road, the vision of 
Stephen at the latter's martyrdom, and his favorite text, I Corinthians 3:18, in 
order to conclude:</P></FONT><FONT size=1>
<P>We ourselves acknowledge that revelation does take place by the Spirit 
through interpretation</P>
<P>as well, but let them admit in their turn that it may also be a divine light, 
shining essentially</P>
<P>and substantially [<U>en ousiai kai hypostasei</U>] in the hearts of the 
faithful...[the] divine and essential</P>
<P>[<U>ousiodes</U>] light which is that which appears and shines in souls more 
than the light of the sun. [55]</P></FONT><FONT size=2>
<P>The relevance of this citation, and like passages in the Homilies, to the 
fourteenth century Hesychast debate over the "light of Tabor", and particularly 
to Gregory Palamas, must be clear, further evidence of what one scholar refers 
to as "an astonishing continuity in Church history" [56].</P>
<P>In still another homily from the same Collection he presents a longer catena 
of proof texts, moving from 2 Cor. 3:18 to 4:6 (the "glory" of Christ within the 
heart), Pss. 118:18 and 42:3 (on light), Acts 9 and 22 (the light at St. Paul's 
conversion), I Cor. 15:49 ("the image of the heavenly man"), Phil. 3:21 (the 
"body of Christ's glory"), I Cor. 2:9-10 ("What eye has not seen..."), and R 
8:11 (the indwelling Spirit) [57]. In yet other places, he will appeal to Moses' 
shining face in Exodus 34, to Ezekiel's vision of the chariot throne of God's 
Glory, to the Synoptic Transfiguration narratives, as well as to the Johannine 
passages, particularly John 14:21-23 and 17:22-24, which promise an indwelling 
manifestation and participation in divine glory, and to Rev 22 on the celestial 
city and the glory which shines within it [58]. Glory,<I> </I><U>doxa</U>, is a 
key term for Macarius. There are some scholars, most recently Hans Veit Beyer, 
who see in this preoccupation with the vision of glory and light a fundamental 
surrender to Neoplatonism [59]. I beg to differ. Macarius certainly owes much to 
the Platonic tradition, though not specifically to the Neoplatonist writers (I 
do not find any echoes of Plotinus or the later Platonists in him -- perhaps 
through Gregory of Nyssa?), and I must also add that I cannot think of any 
single, important patristic writer who does not owe a fair bit to Plato. Given 
the background of Greco-Roman culture, the Platonism of the <U>Homilies</U><I> 
</I>is an inevitable feature of their general emphasis on interiority. What is 
surely more significant about Macarius' use of <U>doxa</U> is that term's 
long-standing use in Greek-speaking Jewish and Christian traditions as the 
translation of the Hebrew <U>kevod</U> YHWH, such as, for example, in such texts 
of the Septuagint as Ex. 24 and 33-34, Nu 12:8 (where <U>doxa</U> translates the 
divine form, <U>temunah</U>, in the context of the <U>visio dei</U>), I K 11, Is 
6 and 40 (the eschatological manifestation, "all flesh shall see..."), Ezk 1, 
8-11, and 43, and -- not mentioned specifically, but implied -- in the shining 
of the righteous in Dan 12 [60]. The texts cited at the head of this paragraph 
give some idea of the term's importance for the New Testament, a feature of 
earliest Christian thought that is only very lately beginning to come into the 
prominence it deserves. <U>Kavod</U> and its Greek equivalent are, put simply, 
the biblical terms of choice for theophany. </P>
<P>What is at work in Macarius' use of <U>doxa</U> is therefore a persistent and 
conscious interiorization of the biblical glory tradition, of theophany. He is 
scarcely alone in this among monastic writers of the late fourth century. 
Evagrius, too, is engaged in exactly the same enterprise, and he is not the only 
such parallel [61]. I myself think that this common endeavor owes not a little 
to the sea-change in Christian thought entailed by the Nicene <U>homoousion</U>, 
whose confirmation at Constantinople we have already seen Macarius endorsing. 
<I></I>The spirituality required by the doctrine of divine consubstantiality did 
not allow for the sort of crudely materialistic or frankly anthropomorphite cast 
to the <U>visio dei</U> suggested by the episcopal heresiologists' accusation, 
noted above, that the Messalians taught a vision of the Trinity accessible to 
the physical eye. We can find similar concerns and debate operative in the 
anthropomorphite controversy among Egyptian monks at the close of the fourth 
century, in Augustine's <U>Confessions</U> (recall his delight at discovering 
the Platonists!), as well as in his <U>De Trinitate</U> and Epistles 147-148, or 
in Cyril of Alexandria's correspondence with Palestinian monks in the 430's 
[62]. To sum up an argument I have made at length elsewhere, there was 
widespread controversy in the late fourth and early fifth centuries about the 
nature of the vision of God, and, further, this controversy was particularly 
associated with the monks [63]. Ancient traditions among Christian ascetics were 
in process of being re-shaped, and monastic leaders like Macarius and Evagrius 
were at the forefront of this reconfiguration. </P>
<P>The nature and provenance of these ancient traditions, together with an 
instructive glimpse into Macarius' program, are perhaps most stunningly 
displayed in the first homily of the better known Collection II. The latter 
begins by summarizing Ezekiel's vision on the banks of the Chebar (Ezk 1:1ff), 
and then goes on to add the following interpretation:</P></FONT><FONT size=1>
<P>The prophet truly and assuredly saw what he saw, but [his vision] also 
suggested something else.</P>
<P>It depicted beforehand something secret and divine, a mystery truly hidden 
from eternity and,</P>
<P>after generations, made manifest in the last days with the appearance [lit. 
epiphany] of Christ.</P>
<P>For Ezekiel beheld the mystery of the soul that is going to receive its Lord 
and become His throne</P>
<P>[<U>thronos</U>] of glory, since the soul which has been made worthy of 
fellowship with the Spirit of His [Christ's] light, and which has been illumined 
by the beauty of His ineffable glory after having prepared itself for Him as a 
throne [<U>kathedra</U>] and dwelling place [<U>katoiketerion</U>], becomes all 
</P>
<P>light and all face and all eye. [64] <I></I></P></FONT><FONT size=2>
<P>There are a number of things worth pointing out in this passage. First, there 
is the emphatic statement that Ezekiel's was a true vision. He really did see 
the glory of God. One might contrast this with Augustine's systematic reduction 
of the Old Testament theophanies to angelophanies, or to mere symbols. I do not 
think, though, that Macarius is primarily concerned here with countering such an 
interpretation, but that he wants rather to make it clear that he is in 
agreement with the interest of his monastic audience in, first of all, according 
this text its full, literal value. Second, I would suggest that they were so 
interested because they hoped to enjoy the sort of vision for which Ezekiel's 
was the likely prototype, by which I mean the sight of the enthroned glory of 
God in the heavenly sanctuary that we find so often to the fore in apocalyptic 
literature and, later on and perhaps simultaneously with writers like Macarius 
and Evagrius, in the <U>merkabah</U> (chariot) lore of the talmudic-era 
<U>hekhalot</U><I> </I>texts [65]. This is not to say that Macarius' monks were 
reading rabbinic literature. They did not need to, since they -- or, certainly, 
other Christian ascetics -- were busy at the time and thereafter translating and 
copying the earlier apocalyptic and other pseudepigraphical materials for 
themselves [66]. Recall, for example, Athanasius' <U>39th Festal Epistle</U> of 
367, where the modern scriptural canon of the Christian churches (less the 
deutercanonical books) appears for the first time, and note that the great 
archbishop provides a list of authoritative books exactly in order to exclude 
apocalyptic texts like the Enochic books and the <U>Ascension of Isaiah</U>, 
about which he tells us certain overly enthusiastic ascetics, "the wretched 
Meletians" in this case, "have been boasting" [67]. We might also bear in mind 
the fact that Athanasius was markedly unsuccessful. Old Testament pseudepigrapha 
and related literature did not disappear immediately even in Egypt, let alone in 
other regions, such as, in our case, Syria-Mesopotamia. Jacob of Serug's long 
homily, <U>On the Chariot that Ezekiel the Prophet Saw</U>, provides significant 
testimony that, a century after Macarius, some Syrian monks were still 
interested -- unhealthily so, in Jacob's view -- in what I take to be an 
apocalyptic or <U>hekhalot</U> type of mystical ascent to see the human form, 
Christ, of the glory enthroned. I might add that I think similar concerns were 
at work in Jacob's anonymous (though more famous) contemporary, the unknown 
Syrian Christian who wrote under the name of Dionysius Areopagites, though no 
one else seems to have picked up on this element in "Dionysius" [68].</P>
<P>Macarius in any case does not oppose this tradition head-on. Instead, he 
affirms Ezekiel's vision, and only then adds his qualifying "but": "but [this] 
also suggests something else". The "something else" in question is my third 
point: Macarius engages in nothing less than a recasting of the ancient 
literatue of ascent and vision to which his monks were so attached. As Gershom 
Scholem put it, in an offhand remark at the close of the chapter on "Merkabah 
Mysticism" in his epocal study , <U>Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism</U>, 
Macarius is engaged in "a mystical reinterpretation" of the <U>Merkabah</U> 
tradition [69]. There is no need to go "up" to heaven to see God on His glorious 
throne, since, "with Christ, everything is within", and therefore the 
chariot-throne of divinity, the place of divine abiding and heavenly palace or 
temple (<U>hekhal</U>, <U>naos</U>), has, through Christ and the gift of the 
Holy Spirit, become the Christian soul itself. Just as Evagrius, in the words of 
Nicholas Sed, provides us with "the first interiorization" of Moses' ascent at 
Sinai "of which we have a written attestation", such that the true mount of 
revelation is relocated to the intellect, so does Macarius rework the motifs of 
tabernacle, temple, and of the ascent to heaven for initiation into its 
mysteries [70]. The "all face and all eye" in the passage cited just above, for 
example, deliberately recalls the four faces and many eyes of the angelic 
bearers of Ezekiel's chariot throne, the "living creatures" or <U>hayyot</U> 
which feature so prominently in both apocalyptic throne visions and in the 
angelogical speculations of the later <U>hekhalot</U> texts [71]. Macarius thus 
continues:</P></FONT><FONT size=1>
<P>The four living creatures which carry the chariot were also carrying a type 
of the four</P>
<P>governing faculties [lit., "thoughts", <U>logismoi</U>] of the soul...I mean 
the will, the conscience,</P>
<P>the intellect [<U>nous</U>], and the power to love [<U>agapetike 
dynamis</U>], for through them the </P>
<P>chariot of the soul is steered, and upon them God takes up His rest 
[<U>epanapauetai</U>]. [72]</P></FONT><FONT size=2>
<P>The One Who rides and directs these steeds, the charioteer, Macarius stresses 
a few lines later, is the Same Who rode upon Ezekiel's cherubim, "Who holds the 
reigns and guides with His Spirit". While this passage obviously owes a great 
deal to Plato's <U>Phaedrus</U>, it is surely also Platonism with a difference. 
For the pagan philolosopher, it is the rational faculty, the <U>logistikon</U>, 
which holds the reigns and directs the soul, but, for our Christian ascetic, the 
intellect has been bumped out of the driver's seat and buckled into harness 
together with the other faculties in order to make room for the true Charioteer, 
Christ God, Who guides the soul with the Holy Spirit [73]. Visionary traditions 
and enthusiasms are not denied in this reworking, for theophany is still held 
out as possible and desirable, but they are tempered, redirected into channels 
more conducive to ascetical sobriety, toward, in fact, that inner warfare we 
noted earlier and the divine help needed to wage it. Attaining to vision within 
must and will only come as the result and gift of the soul's entire restoration 
and transfiguration, and then again, as Macarius frequently puts it elsewhere, 
only -- and fleetingly -- as an anticipation of the Day of Resurrection when the 
divine fire now hidden within the soul will, as it were, emerge and shine forth 
openly from a transformed and risen body [74]. </P>
<P>My fourth observation about the chariot passage provides us with our entry 
into the second area of concern I promised to discuss, the matter of Macarius' 
relation to the sacraments and liturgical assembly which, as we have seen, was 
at issue in the Messalian controversy. In the passage on the chariot we find two 
Greek words used for "throne", <U>thronos</U> and <U>kathedra</U>. The second 
term has an obviously ecclesiastical ring to it, recalling the place of the 
bishop's teaching and presidency at the Church's liturgy. I think that this 
association is quite deliberate on Macarius' part. While he does not pursue the 
echo of church liturgy and even architecture in this particular homily, he 
certainly does so elsewhere, frequently, and, on one occasion at least, at some 
length. Throughout, perhaps his key scriptural texts are 1 Cor 3:16 and 6:19-20, 
especially the latter's equation of the individual Christian's body and the 
temple of the Spirit [75]. This is clearly the basis for the following passage, 
which joins the imagery of sancturary and, very popular among Syrian Christians, 
of nuptial union:</P></FONT><FONT size=1>
<P>The body of the human being is a temple of God...and the human heart is an 
altar of the </P>
<P>Holy Spirit...With the temple of the Lord let us also sanctify the altar, 
that He may light</P>
<P>our lamps and that we may enter into His bridal chamber. [76]</P></FONT><FONT 
size=2>
<P>The Jerusalem Temple was, of course, the place <U>par excellence</U><I> 
</I>of divine abiding in Israel, the object of the Psalmist's frequent desire to 
look upon God's glory. Thus, just as with Ezekiel's <U>Merkabah</U> (itself 
written in part as a response to the imminent loss of the Solomon's temple), 
Macarius also picks up and interiorizes this motif: the holy of holies, the 
<U>debir</U> of the <U>Shekhinah</U>'s abiding, is now the Christian soul. 
Likewise, the priesthood of the sons of Aaron celebrating within the holy place, 
and the ministry of the angels in the heavenly sanctuary, a frequent theme in 
intertestamental literature, is now also fulfilled and active within the soul 
once the latter has acquired -- and been given -- freedom from the passions: 
"For it is in such a heart that God and all the Church of heaven take their 
rest" [77]; and also, with the related imagery of the heavenly Jerusalem, the 
following: "[Christ] Himself ministers [<U>diakonei</U>] to her [the soul] in 
the city of her body, and she in turn ministers to Him in the heavenly city" 
[78]. </P>
<P>The body as temple is the sphere thus of Christ's unique priesthood: "The 
true priest of the future good things...has entered into the tabernacle of their 
[the believer's] bodies, and he ministers to and heals the pasions" [79]. That 
which He effects within is, earlier in the same homily, specifically likened to 
the sacramental change, <U>metobole</U>, of the eucharistic elements, and in 
such a way as also to recall the Eastern (and especially Syrian) Christian 
tradition of the consecratory invocation of the Holy Spirit, the 
<U>epiklesis</U>:</P></FONT><FONT size=1>
<P>For our Lord came for this reason, that He might change [<U>allaxai</U>] and 
transform [<U>metabalein</U>]</P>
<P>and renew and recreate the soul which had been overturned by the 
passions...mingling with it</P>
<P>His own Spirit of divinity...to make new men, anointing them with His own 
light of knowledge,</P>
<P>that He might put in them the new wine which is His Spirit. 
[80]</P></FONT><FONT size=2>
<P>Another term Macarius uses with this same kind of echo is the word, 
<U>synaxis</U>. It means gathering or assembling, or a gathering or assembly, 
and is of course familiar to liturgists as an ancient expression for the 
liturgical assembly of the Church. In several passages, Macarius employs it 
simply, or with at least apparent simplicity, for the soul's "gathering" of its 
scattered thoughts, <U>logismoi</U>, in order, as he puts it in one such 
passage, that Christ may "gather her unto Himself and make her thoughts divine, 
and teach her true prayer" [82]. I say apparent simplicity because it becomes 
evident elsewhere that he does mean it to carry a specifically ecclesiastical 
and liturgical resonance, as in the following:</P></FONT><FONT size=1>
<P>"Church" is therefore said with regard both to the many and to the single 
soul. For that soul </P>
<P>which gathers [<U>synagei</U>] all its thoughts is also the Church of 
God...and this term [thus] applies </P>
<P>in the case both of many [Christians] and of one. [83]</P></FONT><FONT 
size=2>
<P>This citation is an obvious and open appeal to the principle of microcosm and 
macrocosm, the soul as a microcosm of the Church's macrocosm. Put another way, 
and borrowing an expression from Macarius' equally anonymous contemporary, the 
author of the <U>Liber Graduum</U>, the Christian, and particularly the 
Christian heart or soul, is a "little church" [84]. Mention of the <U>Liber</U> 
leads me to point out that, in all that we have touched on so far regarding 
Macarius' use of the language of temple and church, he is drawing on a manner of 
speaking which has many precedents, some of them very old indeed. The notion of 
the Christian as ecclesiastical microcosm -- and, indeed, microcosm as well of 
the Paradise Mountain and of the Sinai of theophany -- is at the least 
adumbrated in Ephrem Syrus' <U>Paradise Hymns</U>, while the body as "temple" 
goes back, as noted, to St. Paul [85]. We might also look to the <U>Acts of 
Thomas</U> in the earlier Syrian milieu where the bodies of the ascetics are 
hailed as temples, places of Christ's indwelling, and where the "holy ones" are 
in consequence even accorded sacerdotal powers, "empowered to forgive sins" 
[86]. Aphrahat speaks similarly of the Christian's priestly office of prayer 
[87]. The Alexandrian writers from Philo to Origen draw conscious comparisons 
between the worship of the community and liturgy of the soul [88], while 
Macarius' placing of the ascetic's body and soul in parallel with the 
eucharistic elements may also draw on Ignatius of Antioch's and Polycarp of 
Smyrna's second century characterization of the martyr's body as locus of 
theophany and sacramentally transformed, as well as their obvious deployement of 
eucharistic language in order to depict that transformation, and we should note 
that they in their turn were the heirs of still older, Jewish traditions of the 
martyr as a holy and reconciling sacrifice [89]. It is, by the way, a truism 
that the fourth century monastic movement drew on the imagery of martyrdom. What 
is perhaps less appreciated is the real possibility that the same imagery, and 
for likely just as long, had been applied to the ascetics. Christianity in 
Persian Mesopotamia seems to bear this out. There it was martyrdom that was the 
more recent, fourth century experience. When it thus came time to write the 
martyrologies, the language the authors used was that which previously their 
communities had employed for their ascetics -- precisely the reverse of the 
sequence in the Roman world [90]. </P>
<P>Traditional, yes, and even ancient, but it is equally evident that many 
bishops at the end of the fourth century felt that this language threatened 
proper regard for the sacraments and, to be sure, that thereby their own 
authority was placed in question. With respect to the second concern, I would 
say that they were probably in part justified, though I would add that the real 
authority of the charismatic saint, almost inevitably an ascetic or monastic, 
has been a constant thorn in the Eastern hierarchy's side from the Messalian 
controversy and before to the present day, and that there is no sign that it 
will ever be removed short of the eschaton -- for which God be praised [91]. 
Regarding the bishops' concern over proper evaluation of the sacraments, 
however, there was surely misunderstanding, at least so far Macarius was 
concerned. The latter not only wrote of baptism and eucharist in such a way as 
to make it clear he accepted and indeed embraced the Church's doctrine, but in 
one of his homilies he also sought to reply both to the bishops and, on the 
other side of his typically two-way dialogue, surely as well to some of his 
monks who were raising questions, by elaborating on the notion of the 
ecclesiastical microcosm in such a way as to exercise profound influence on 
subsequent Eastern Christian thought, practice, piety, and even, I think, church 
architecture. I shall touch first and briefly on his affirmations of the 
traditional teaching before turning to his contribution.</P>
<P>Baptism and eucharist are real for Macarius. His understanding of the former 
was most usefully discussed by Dom Vincent Desprez in an article published ten 
years ago [92]. While acknowledging that Macarius shared with his Syrian 
Christian background in a certain neglect respecting the Pauline theme of 
baptism as a sharing in Christ's death (R 6), Dom Vincent points out his equally 
Syrian emphasis on the sacrament as the "earnest", <U>arrabon</U>, of the gift 
of the Holy Spirit [93]. This eschatological emphasis is the fore, of course, 
throughout all of his writings. In the case of baptism, the use of the imagery 
of the "earnest" and "talent" given the believer in the sacrament looks ever 
toward eschatological fulfillment, and opens thus onto the dynamic of growth 
into a conscious and perfected Christian life. Macarius is always interested in 
process. He thus criticizes in one homily what he takes to be his critics' 
static and in effect magical view of sacramental efficacy, insisting instead 
that, though participation in the Spirit through baptism is real indeed, that 
participation is an invitation to progress, to an increase in love and virtue 
and awareness "according to the measure" of each believer's faith, 
<U>kat'analogian tes pisteos</U> [94]. On the other hand, if baptismal grace is 
left uncultivated, the "earth of the heart" can indeed revert to weeds and 
thorns, that is, suffer again the inhabitation of evil. To be sure, later 
ascetic writers such as Mark the Monk and Diadochus of Photiki in the following 
century would, in view of the episcopal condemnations, develop and refine the 
Macarian teaching, laying more stress on baptism's ties with the Cross, 
stressing the plenitude of the gifts received, and moderating his language 
concerning the post-baptismal indwelling of evil, but in substance their 
modifications have much more in common with Macarius than they differ from him 
[95].</P>
<P>As for the eucharist, Macarius admittedly speaks relatively little of it, at 
least when he is not in a polemical mode replying to his critics. Yet this is 
scarcely untypical of monastic writers, and, when he does write of it, his 
language is fully traditional, as in the following citation with its typical 
emphasis on the Spirit:</P></FONT><FONT size=1>
<P>Those who have truly partaken of the bread of the eucharist are made worthy 
of becoming</P>
<P>partakers of the Holy Spirit, and thus holy souls are enabled to live 
everlastingly. Just as he</P>
<P>who drinks wine possesses the latter mingled with all his members...so, too, 
with him who</P>
<P>drinks the blood of Christ, for the Spirit of divinity which is drunk is 
mingled with the perfect </P>
<P>soul and the latter is mingled with the Spirit and, thus sanctified, becomes 
worthy of the Lord. [96]</P></FONT><FONT size=2>
<P>Then there is also the passage where, interpreting I Cor 2:9, "what eye hath 
seen", he holds out the sacraments as that which the prophets did not not see, 
though they foretold Messiah's coming: </P></FONT><FONT size=1>
<P>...neither did it come to their understanding that there would be a baptism 
of fire and the Holy</P>
<P>Spirit, and that bread and wine would be offered in the Church as an antitype 
of the Lord'sbody </P>
<P>and blood, and that those who partake of the visible bread spiritually eat 
His flesh, and that the Apostles </P>
<P>and Christians would receive the Comforter and be clothed with power from on 
high and filled with </P>
<P>divinity, and that souls would be mingled with the Holy Spirit. None of this 
did the prophets know. [97]</P></FONT><FONT size=2>
<P>I would also add the texts which I cited above in connection with the 
believer as microcosm. Macarius would surely not be using a word like 
<U>metabole</U>, with its echo of eucharistic consecration, for the inner 
transformation of the soul unless both he and his audience understood and 
accepted the term's original reference to the mysterious change of the 
sacramental elements. The allusion and implied analogy would otherwise lose 
their intended force, that is, as the elements are truly changed through the 
action of the Spirit at the Church's altar, so must it be with the "inner man" 
at the altar of the heart. </P>
<P>In sum, throughout the Macarian corpus the eucharist is understood as at once 
the real anticipation and the illustration of the Christian's eschatological 
transformation. The latter element, the illustrative character, or perhaps we 
might better say, the iconic aspect of the eucharistic assembly is what draws 
Macarius' particular attention in Homily 52 of Collection I, where I would see 
him as, typically, addressing both his episcopal critics and certain among his 
own monks, or monastic correspondents, who had raised questions about the 
importance of the liturgy [98]. Here, too, is where he makes another signal 
contribution to the thought of Greek-speaking Christianity: the visible church 
as the divinely given icon here below of the transfigured inner man called to 
participate in the heavenly liturgy. This is the note on which he begins his 
homily:</P></FONT><FONT size=1>
<P>The whole visible arrangement of the Church of God came to pass for the sake 
of the living</P>
<P>and intelligent substance [<U>noera ousia</U>] of the rational soul which was 
made according to the</P>
<P>image of God, and which is the living and true Church of God...For the Church 
of Christ and </P>
<P>temple of God and true altar and living sacrifice is the man of God. 
[99]</P></FONT><FONT size=2>
<P>He criticizes his critics for their superficiality: "They have complete 
confidence in the temporary arrangement and only trust in statutes of the 
flesh". Neglecting "the seeking according to the inner man and the renewal of 
the soul... they slander us out of ignorance". This does not mean that Macarius 
denies the reality of the present dispensation of altar and sacraments: "God 
gave His Holy Spirit to the holy and catholic Church, and arranged that He be 
present at the holy altar and in the water of holy baptism", so that, through 
this presence and divine action, "faithful hearts...might be renewed and 
refashioned by the power of grace" [100]. The Spirit was present in the Ark of 
Covenant of the Old Dispensation, so how much more then is this not the case for 
the Christian altar? But visible realities, as we have seen, are for Macarius 
always subordinate to the invisible, to the unseen and secret work within, 
thus:</P></FONT><FONT size=1>
<P>Because visible things are the type and shadow of the hidden ones, and the 
visible temple </P>
<P>[a type] of the temple of the heart, and the priest [a type] of the grace of 
Christ, and all the</P>
<P>rest of the sequence of the visible arrangement [a type] of the rational and 
hidden matters</P>
<P>according to the inner man, we receive the manifest arrangement and 
administration of the</P>
<P>Church as an illustration [<U>hypodeigma</U>] of what is at work in the soul 
by grace. [101]</P></FONT><FONT size=2>
<P>In the concluding section of the homily he develops this statement by taking 
up the sequence, <U>akolouthia</U>, of the eucharistic liturgy and the physical 
arrangement, <U>oikonomia</U>, of the assembled believers, by which he means, 
respectively, the two halves of the service, the liturgies of the word 
(<U>synaxis</U>) and of the eucharist proper (<U>anaphora</U>), and the 
progression from the catechumens in the church porch to the baptized believers 
in the nave to the presbyters on either side of the bishop's throne in the 
sanctuary apse. The first he presents as an image of the relationship of ascetic 
efforts to the grace of the Spirit. Just as the consecration of the gifts and 
holy communion crown and complete the reading and meditation on the scriptures 
in the service's first part, so does the "mystical activity of the Spirit" crown 
and complete the efforts of "vigil, prayer, ascesis, and every virtue". Neither 
one is sufficient without the other; both are required. The <U>anaphora</U> must 
have the <U>synaxis</U> to precede it, while the latter is obviously incomplete 
without the consecration and communion. Similarly, there is no point to ascetic 
labors without the visitation of the Spirit, but He will not rest upon us unless 
we labor in our turn. The physical ordering of the assembly likewise mirrors the 
ascent of the believer to God and participation in the heavenly liturgy. Just as 
"those who do not sin and make progress...come eventually to the priesthood, and 
are transferred from some outer place [presumably referring to the church porch] 
up to the altar so that they may become God's ministers and assistants 
[<U>leitourgoi kai paredroi</U>]" -- the sequence of promotion in the church's 
hierarchy, with the last phrase likely referring to the deacons and presbyters 
at the bishop's throne -- so the soul,</P></FONT><FONT size=1>
<P>If...it does not embitter grace...but rather pleasingly follows the dominical 
statutes...and with all its </P>
<P>faculty of choice cleaves at all times to the Lord and welcomes grace, then 
indeed... it progresses and </P>
<P>is made worthy...of promotion and spiritual rank, and...will be inscribed in 
the Kingdom among the </P>
<P>perfect workers and with the blameless ministers and assistants 
[<U>leitourgoi kai paredroi</U>] of Christ. [102] </P></FONT><FONT size=2>
<P>In its temporal sequence and spatial ordering, the order (<U>kosmos</U>) of 
the Church's liturgy therefore reflects both the order of the Spirit's activity 
within and cooperation with the soul, and the latter's rise to share in the 
ministry of the angels in the heavenly temple, that is, with those who serve 
(<U>leitourgoi</U>) and who stand beside (<U>paredroi</U>) the throne of 
Christ.</P>
<P>The notion of the Church's prayer as a participation in and reflection of the 
liturgy of heaven is very old, indeed, arguably with roots in the New Testament 
and, even before, in Second Temple Judaism [103], while the idea of the human 
soul as microcosm of the Church is, as I noted above, likewise very old. What 
Macarius brings to these themes is a more precise development and coordination. 
He argues systematically in this homily that what we see when we participate in 
the liturgy is a divinely established image or -- in the fully sacramental sense 
that the term would later acquire -- icon both of heaven, and of ourselves and 
our calling as Christians. Now, some might feel -- and have felt -- that this is 
an unfortunate allegorization of the liturgy and thereby a surrender, again, to 
Platonism [104]. We certainly do have a kind of allegorization here, and, 
equally, it owes not a little to Plato, but I do not agree that it is so 
regrettable. Let us first recall that Macarius is writing to his monks, and 
that, secondly, he does so at least as much to persuade them of the importance 
of the visible Church's worship as to engage his critics among the bishops. It 
is in this effort to reconcile his ascetics to the liturgy by demonstrating its 
relevance and application to their own intense focus on the inner life that we 
discover the lasting importance of what he has to say. He insists that the 
communal and objective character of public worship is both true, being grounded 
in divine revelation, and that it at once aids and reflects the Christian's own 
subjective appropriation of the unique sacrament, <U>mysterion</U>, of Christ. I 
would insist that the key here is the "both, and", and the reconciliation or 
harmony that it seeks to effect between the sacramental and the mystical, 
objective and subjective, public and private, institutional and charismatic, or 
-- in Macarius' own terms -- altar and heart. As the revealed icon of heaven and 
of the heart, the Church's altar becomes the necessary, middle term between the 
two, at once communicating heaven to us and leading us to its manifestation 
within us. Its role is a temporary one, since "the whole arrangement and 
ministry of the heavenly mysteries of the Church will pass away at the 
conclusion of the age", then, when heaven and glorified humanity will merge and 
become one, but, for now, in the present time of attendance and anticipation, it 
mediates the eschaton to us in image and in truth. </P>
<P>I cannot then regard Macarius' efforts here as in any sense a surrender or 
betrayl, for it seems to me that what he accomplished served in a very 
fundamental way to preserve the unity of the Church of the bishops, 
sacramentally based and necessarily structured, with the enthusiasm, 
charismaticism and generally inward thrust of the monastic movement. He helped 
establish the two in a union which, while it has had its tensions, has never 
since been broken. He was not alone in this endeavor. To be sure, Athanasius and 
Basil had also contributed significantly to this project, though not with 
respect to the specific matter of the "inner church" [105]. I have, however, 
already mentioned Ephrem Syrus' adumbrations of this reconciliation in his 
<U>Paradise Hymns</U>, and can point as well to the exact same ideas as 
Macarius, and probably for the exact same reasons, in the twelfth <U>mimro</U> 
of the <U>Liber Graduum</U><I> </I>[106]. But both of the latter two works were 
written in Syriac, and neither one to my knowledge was ever translated into 
Greek, certainly not the <U>Liber</U>. So it is chiefly at Macarius' door that I 
would it place the later works of Dionysius Areopagites, especially on the 
hierarchies, and Maximus Confessor's <U>Mystagogy</U>, together with pervasive 
strains in, for example, the writings of Symeon New Theologian, Gregory of 
Sinai, and Nicholas Cabasilas [107]. These writers reflect over a thousand years 
of Greek-speaking Christianity. They also represent much of the best that the 
Eastern Christian world has to offer. </P>
<P>Macarius fully deserved the efforts his immediate successors must have 
expended to preserve his writings from the oblivion that befell too many others 
who ran afoul of hasty condemnations. He wrote about what he knew, both from 
scripture and tradition, and from his own experience, and he did so in such a 
way as to weave together into a single compelling tapestry threads from many, 
not always harmonious earlier Christian and pre-Christian groups and traditions. 
His was a genuine ministry of synthesis and reconciliation whose power to speak 
to subsequent generations sprang from the quality of its living and lived 
witness to the transfiguration promised by the Gospels and Apostles, to that 
change, effected by the Spirit of the risen Christ, which is at work in 
Christians even now, provided only they pledge their trust and longing. </P>
<P>Some years ago, after having been invited to sit in on a session of the 
Orthodox-Lutheran dialogue, I remember asking a prominent Lutheran theologian of 
my acquaintance how he pictured a Lutheran saint. He was at a loss for words for 
a moment, and then graciously admitted that he had never really given the matter 
any thought. For me, on the other hand, it still seems a very important 
question, even fundamental. What is the ideal we have of the Christian life in 
this world? Can it be lived? Whom may we look to for examples in our own and 
recent times, and throughout the history of the Church? Some this perspective 
strikes me as having been shared by the Wesleys. Thus when, at the sessions of 
their Holy Club, John and Charles Wesley picked up and read Macarius, and loved 
him in spite of the gulf of time and space, and equally of the centuries-old 
divisions of culture and in the Church which separated fourth century 
Mesopotamia from eighteenth century England, I would like to think that they 
were responding to the same Spirit Who inspired him [108]. If, moreover, that 
Spirit is the one and unique river of life which flows from the throne of God 
and of the Lamb, then might we not find in the welcoming response of two saintly 
Englishmen to this Syrian holy man, who so deeply impressed the thought and 
practice of Eastern Christianity, a kind of proof that those ages of difference 
and division can in fact be transcended and -- who knows? -- perhaps even the 
hope that they can be reconciled? Surely, if we look first to our saints for the 
truth of Christ's promises, for the presence in this age of the age to come, for 
the signs of the Spirit in short, will we not find a more certain, or at least a 
more promising ground for ecumenical encounter than merely the mutual exchange 
of confessional statements? We Orthodox are fond of saying that Orthodoxy is 
most fundamentally neither a system of doctrine nor an institution, important as 
both those are, but first and last a way of life, as in Bishop Kallistos' little 
book, <U>The Orthodox Way</U>. We do not very often live up to that claim, but 
we can and do point to those whom we believe have done so, to our saints, as the 
proof of things unseen and embodying the substance of things hoped for. I have 
the impression that that is part of the purpose of our meetings here this week. 
If so, it is a worthy project, and I hope that this paper has made some small 
contribution to it. Thank you. </P>

<U>Neue Homilien des Makarios/Symeon. Aus Typus III</U>, ed. E. Klostermann and

Oeuvres spirituelles. Vol. I: Homelies propres a la Collection III</U>, in 
<U>Sources chretiennes</U> 275 (Paris:1980). When referring to or quoting from 
Macarius below, I shall be using my own translations unless otherwise stated, 
and referring to the original language texts above. Citations in the notes below 
will begin with uppercase Roman numerals for the Collections, followed by arabic 
numerals for the specific homiliy and its subsections.</P>
<P>The first item in the MSS of Collection I, Macarius' <U>Great Letter</U>, is 
not included in Berthold's edition as it was edited previously by W. Jaeger, 
<U>Two Rediscovered Works of Ancient Christian Literature: Gregory of Nyssa and 
Macarius</U> (Leiden:1965). It was Jaeger's thesis that Macarius had based this 
treatise on Gregory's shorter work, <U>On Christian Perfection</U> (also 
included in <U>Rediscovered Works</U>). A second edition of the <U>Letter</U>, 
however, together with the close analysis of its editor, R. Staats, in the 
latter's <U>Makarios-Symeon: Epistola Magna</U> (Goettingen:1980), demonstrated 
convincingly that the relationship was in fact the reverse, i.e., that Gregory 
edited Macarius. In that Macarius elsewhere appears often to have availed 
himself of ideas characteristic of Gregory (as well of as Basil the Great, see 
below, n.11), the evidence has been building for "an environment of mutual 
exchange" between the author of the <U>Homilies</U> and the great Cappadocians, 
to quote from Mr. S. Burns' paper, "'Sober Intoxication' as a metaphor for 
divine ecstasy in Gregory of Nyssa and Ps-Macarius", given at the North American 
Patristics Society Conference at Loyola, Chicago, in June 1998. I look forward 
to the eventual publication of Mr. Burns' thesis on this subject as it promises 
to be the most thorough study on Macarius' Syrian and Greek background available 
in English.</P>
<P>5. The name, Symeon of Mesopotamia, is often attached (particularly by German 
scholars) to "Macarius", owing to the appearance of that name, a leader in the 
Messalian movement, in a few of the ancient MSS. H. Doerries was the first to 
raise the possibility of Symeon in <U>Symeon von Mesopotamien. Die 
Ueberlieferung des messalianischen Makarios-Schriften</U> (Leipzig:1941), and 
was followed by many thereafter. For a brief consideration of the question of 
Macarius' identity, see V. Desprez, "Macaire", in <U>Dictionnaire de 
spiritualite</U> X:27, and at greater length in his "Introduction" to the 
<U>SC</U> edition of Collection III, pp.32-37.</P>
<P>6. Evagrius was preserved, partially, in Greek under the name of Nilus of 
Sinai, but the <U>Kephalaia Gnostica</U>, his main doctrinal work, survives only 
in two Syriac translations, tr. and ed. by A. Guillaumont, <U>Patrologia 
Orientalis</U> XXVIII. His Origenism was the source of his later condemnation in 
553, and the best study of his thought in that regard is still Guillaumont's 
<U>Les "Kephalaia Gnostica" d'Evagre le pontique</U> (Paris:1962). More recent 
studies by, especially, G. Bunge have served to place Evagrius more securely in 
the setting of Egyptian eremeticism, and somewhat to ameliorate the charge of 
heresy. Thus, in chronological order, see the latter's "Evagre le Pontique et 
les deux Macaires", <U>Irenikon</U> 56 (1983) 215-227 and 323-360; "On the 
Trinitarian Mysticism of Evagrius of Pontus", <U>Studia Monastica</U> 17 (1986) 
191-208; "Origenismus-Gnostizismus: zum geistesgeschichtlichen Standort des 
Evagrios Pontikos", <U>Vigiliae Christianae</U> 40 (1986) 24-54; <U>Geistliche 
Vaterschaft: Christliche Gnosis bei Evagrios Pontikos</U> (Regensburg:1988); and 
perhaps especially "Henade ou Monade? Au sujet des deux notions centrales de la 
terminologie evagrienne", <U>Le Museon</U> 102 (1989) 69-91.</P>
<P>7. Desprez, "Macaire", <U>DSp.</U> 39.</P>
<P>8. For the background in Wisdom literature and Cynic diatribe to the literary 
form Evagrius largely invents for Eastern monastic literature, the "chapters" or 
short sayings, see W.R. Schoedel, "Jewish Wisdom and the Formation of the 
Christian Ascetic", in R. Wilken, ed., <U>Aspects of Wisdom in Judaism and Early 
Christianity</U> (Notre Dame:1975) 169-199; and also, specifically in Evagrius, 
J. Driscoll, OSB, <U>The "Ad Monachos" of Evagrius Ponticus: Its Structure and a 
Select Commentary</U> (Roma:1991) 307-384. On meditation in the Egyptian 
hermitages, see D. Burton-Christie, <U>The Word in the Desert: Scripture and the 
Quest for Holiness in Early Christian Monasticism</U> (Oxford/NY:1993) 
76-177.</P>
<P>9. For Macarius as himself the recipient of revelations, see II.8, cited 
below, esp. II.8.6. On the necessity of an inspired guide, see I.4.12; II.14.4; 
15.20 (saints as <U>theodidaktoi</U>); 18.5-6; III.7.3-4 (vs. false guides); 
14.1; and 16.3; but against false claims to perfection, impossible in this life, 
see II.8.5; 15.36 (we are always free to fall); 17.5-6; 38.4-5; I.31.6; 39 and 
64 (the need for meekness vs. conceit); III.22.1-2 (vs. pretenders to knowledge 
through intellectual effort alone); and for comment, Doerries, <U>Theologie des 
Makarios/Symeon</U>, 336-366. On the phenomenon of the enlightened elders in the 
fourth century (and afterwards) and their claims to authority, often in tension 
with the official hierarchy, see, e.g., P. Rousseau, <U>Ascetics, Authority, and 
the Church</U> (Oxford:1978) 18-67; P. Brown, <U>Society and the Holy in Late 
Antiquity</U> (Berkeley:1982) 103-195; and A. Golitzin, <U>St. Symeon the New 
Theologian on the Mystical Life</U>, vol. III, <U>Life, Times, Theology</U> 
(NY:1997) 19-21 and 38-53. </P>
<P>10. On the social and ecclesiastical setting of monasticism in Asia Minor and 
upper Mesopotamia, see J. Gribomont, "Le monachisme au sein de l'eglise en Syrie 
et en Cappadoce", <U>Studia Monastica</U> 7 (1965) 7-24; I. Pena et. alii, 
<U>Les reclus syriens: recherches sur les anciennes formes de vie solitaire en 
Syrie</U> (Milano:1980) esp. 93-162 on the life and continual contacts of Syrian 
hermits with larger groups; and S.H. Griffith, "Asceticism in the Church of 
Syria: The Hermeneutics of Early Syrian Monasticism", in V.L. Wimbush and R. 
Valentasis, ed.s, <U>Asceticism</U> (Oxford/NY:1995) 220-245. On Macarius' 
<U>Great Letter</U> as a "rule" for his community ascetics, see Staats, 
"Messalianerforschungen" 56-57, and in detail, <U>Epistola Magna</U> 63-72.</P>
<P>11. Doerries' annotations in his edition of <U>Die 50 geistliche Homilien</U> 
are especially good on noting links to apocryphal materials, as well as other 
echoes of earlier Christian writers. See also G. Quispel, <U>Makarius, das 
Thomasevangelium, and das Leid von der Perle</U> (Leiden:1967) on the echoes of 
the earlier Syriac literature of the Thomas tradition; together with A. Baker, 
"Syriac and the Scriptural Quotations of Pseudo-Macarius", <U>Journal of 
Theological Studies</U> 20 (1969) 133-149; and Stewart, <U>"Working the 
Earth"</U> 84-95, 188-203, and 211-233 for parallels in later, fourth century 
Syriac literature. I know of no studies devoted to the influence of Clement and 
Origen, but see Desprez, "Introduction", <U>SC</U> 275, 55-56; and for the 
Cappadocians, esp. R.Staats, <U>Epistola Magna</U>, and, ibidem, <U>Gregor von 
Nyssa und die Messalianer</U> (Berlin:1968), as well as the forthcoming work by 
S. Burns, n.4 above. I shall touch on some possible parallels with Jewish 
thought on specific issues below. </P>
<P>12. See above, n.6, and especially N. Sed, "La shekinta et ses amis 
arameens", in <U>Cahiers d'Orientalisme</U> XX (1988) 233-242 for Evagrius' 
links with Jewish exegesis on the <U>visio dei</U>.</P>

greater detail, M. O'Laughlin, <U>Origenism in the Desert: Anthropology and 
Integration in Evagrius Ponticus</U>, MS Phd. (University of Michigan, Ann 
Arbor:1988) esp. 88-188. The sketch of Evagrius' thought in David Evans' 
<U>Leontius of Byzantium: An Origenist Christology</U> (Wash.DC:1970) 89-111 may 
also be consulted with profit.</P>
<P>16. The citation is from I.18.7.3. For other references to the 
Transfiguration, see I.10.3.1; II.4.13; 8.3; 15.38. For more examples of the 
contrast between the "now" (<U>nyn</U>) of the light within, and the "then" 
(<U>tote</U>) of the body's visible glorification, see I.18.6; 24; 28.1; 58.3; 
II.2.5; 5.7-12; 11.1; 15.38; 34.2; and III.2.1. On the place of the 
Transfiguration in particularly Eastern Christian thought, see J. A. McGuckin, 
<U>The Transfiguration of Christ in Scripture and Tradition</U> 
(Lewiston/Queensland:1986) 99-128, esp. 117-128 on the Gospel episode taken as 
an illustration of the deification of the flesh, and as an epiphany of the age 
to come.</P>
<P>17. Macarius certainly makes use of "heart" as equivalent to "inner man", 
thus see I.3.2; 4.30; 27.2; 39; 54.2-3; II.4.4; 5.4; 8.3; 10.1; 11.9-13; 13.1; 
15.8,20,28,33-34; 19.7; 24.2; 26.21-22; 32.3; 43.3 and 7; III.3.2; 20.2; 28.4; 
<U>Great Letter</U> 6, 22, 34, 40, and 42. Elsewhere, however, he will freely 
use "inner man", soul, or even intellect (<U>nous</U>) instead of "heart", as 
in, for example, virtually all his references to the inner temple (<U>naos</U>), 
church (<U>ekklesia</U>), house (<U>oikos</U>) or dwelling-place 
(<U>oiketerion</U>) or palace (<U>palation</U>) or throne <U>(thronos</U>) or 
city (<U>polis</U>) or altar (<U>thysiasterion</U>) or tabernacle (<U>skene</U>) 
of God: I.3.3; 4.7 (soul); 5.3 (intellect); 7.18 (soul and inner man); 25.1 
(soul); 29.2 (soul); 40.1 (soul); II.1.2 (soul); 6.5 (intellect); 12.15 (soul);

(soul); 45.5 (soul); 47.14 (soul); III.6.2 (soul); 19.2 (soul); 21.3 (soul); 
25.4 (soul); and 27.6 (soul). Relatedly on the importance of the soul or "inner 
man", see I.5.2; 18.7 ("inner man" as the image of God); 23.2; 24 (soul as key 
to the spiritual reading of Scripture); 25.1 (soul as locus of interior 
warfare); 40.1; 54.2-3; 62 (intellect called to rule over passions); 64; 
II.28.1; 30; 37.1; 43.7 (the intellect as the "eye of the heart", and cf. II.6.8

see I.18.4; 27.2; 33.3; 34; III.4; and 31.1 and 3. For military language, see 
I.20.2; 60.2; II.5.5; 11.14; 15.28 and 33; 21; 27.20-23; III.9.4; 23.5 ("holy 
war"); and esp. I.50.4, with its appeal to Dt.20's call to "holy war", together 
with R. Murray, "An Exhortation to Candidates for Ascetical Vows at Baptism in 
the Ancient Syrian Church", <U>New Testament Studies</U> 21 (1974) 59-80 on the 
antiquity of this appeal, going back to the texts of Qumran.</P>
<P>22. For the "bubbling spring" and related imagery, see I.6.3 (the spring); 
25.1 (invisible wounds of soul); 36 (serpent within); 50.1 (mingling of passions 
with soul); II.2.2-3 (inhabitation of evil); 15.48 (inner spring of evil); 20.4; 
III.25.11; 26.5 (veiling of soul); and for comment, Doerries, <U>Theologie</U> 
63-75.</P>
<P>23. III.26.3; and see M. Canevet, "Macaire", <U>DSp.</U> X:32-33.</P>
<P>24. See, for example, Macarius on the traditional scriptural locus for 
deification, 2 Pet. 1:4 ("partakers of the divine nature"), in I.1.8; 14.23; 
54.5.6; II.25.5; 34.2; 39; 49.9; III.8.2; 18.1; and Doerries, <U>Theologie</U> 
316-348. For deification in Ephrem and a comparison with the Alexandrians and 
Cappadocians, see S.P. Brock, <U>The Luminous Eye: The Spiritual World Vision of 
Ephrem the Syrian</U> (rev.ed., Kalamazoo:1992) 145-154. </P>
<P>25. For Christ the healer of the soul's wounds and the "hidden passions", see 
I.2.10; 25.1; 63.3; and II.20.4 and 6. On the importance of Christ as physician 
in Syrian Christian thought, see R. Murray, <U>Symbols of Church and Kingdom</U> 
(Cambridge:1975) 199-203.</P>
<P>26. For a by no means exhaustive sampling of 2 Cor. 3:7-4:6 in Macarius, see 
I.10.3; 28.2; 48.2; II.5.5; 25.3; III.3.2 and 28.2.</P>
<P>27. III.8.1.</P>
<P>28. See I.2.3 (on Gen.3 as at once historical and psychological); 24 
(Israel's history as that of the soul); II.25.7 (the Christian and the Exodus 
narrative); 28.1 (the soul as Jerusalem despoiled); 42.15 (Passover and Exodus 
as "mysteries of the soul"); 47.2-13 (again, the soul and Israel's history); 
III.20.1 (the soul and resurrection); and 24 (soul as tabernacle of David).</P>
<P>29. See esp. II.34.1-2 for Christ as house and tabernacle and city. On the 
development of the post-biblical term, <U>shekhinah</U>, in the Targumim and 
early rabbis, see A. M. Goldberg, <U>Untersuchungen ueber die Vorstellung von 
der Shekhinah in der fruehen rabbinischen Literatur</U> (Berlin:1969), esp. 
439-530; and, particularly for the antiquity of the expression, "glory of the 
<U>Shekhinah</U>", D. Munoz-Leon, <U>Gloria de la Shekina en los Targumim del 
Penteteuco</U> (Madrid:1977), esp. his conclusions 487-494. The term, 
<U>shekinto</U>, turns up in Christian writers in Syriac, for example in 
Ephrem's <U>Paradise Hymns</U> 2.12; 3.1, 6, and 12-13; and 10.12 (identified 
with the Presence enthroned at the Tree of Life and visible atop Sinai, 
respectively), and, over a century later, in Jacob of Serug's "On the Chariot 
that Ezekiel the Prophet Saw", in <U>Mar Jacobi Sarugensis: Homiliae 
Selectae</U>, ed. P. Bedjan (Paris:1908), vol. IV, 569:19-29; 570:13; and 
602:20; and for the related term, <U>yikoro</U> (glory), see 559:13; 571:17; 
576:2; 592:5; and 593:13. In each case, Ephrem and Jacob, the terms in question 
seem primarily identified with Christ. Macarius, I think, stands within this 
tradition, thus see my remarks on light and glory below.</P>
<P>30. See n.17 above, and my discussion of baptism in Macarius below.</P>
<P>31. A glance at Lampe, <U>A Patristic Greek Lexicon</U>, 1323-1324, should 
sufice for the widespread use of this term and its relatives in Greek Christian 
authors.</P>
<P>32. On the need for trials and struggles, see for example I.2.3.7-9; 20.1-2; 
62; II.3.4; 5.5; 15.28; 19.1ff (need of "violence"); III.1; 4.3; 5; and 9.1.</P>
<P>33. I.50.4.4.</P>
<P>34. Ibid. 4.6.</P>
<P>35. For Macarius on the equivalence of <U>eros</U> and <U>agape</U>, see 
II.5.5; 10.4; 15.37; and <U>Great Letter</U> 23; in Gregory Nyssa, e.g., <U>Vita 
Moysii</U> II.231-232 (<U>SC</U> 1:106-107), and for comment, J. Danielou, 
<U>Platonisme et theologie mystique</U> (Paris:1944) 201 ff., and Origen's 
"Prologue"to his commentary on <U>The Song of Songs</U> (tr. Lawson, <U>Ancient 
Christian Writers</U> 26, pp. 30-38).</P>
<P>36. See thus Macarius on the insatiable (<U>akorestos</U>) yearning 
(<U>eros</U>), love (<U>agape</U>), or longing <U>(pothos</U>) in I.21; and 
II.10.1-2, together with the endless appropriation of grace in II.8.6 and 
continual "stretching" (<U>epekteinesthai</U>) in <U>Great Letter</U> 14. It is 
difficult not to see in this a reaction to the notion of "satiation" with 
divinity traditionally ascribed to Origen, and an echo of Gregory of Nyssa's 
notion of <U>epektasis</U>. For the latter, see P. Deseille, "Epectase", 
<U>D.Sp.</U> !V:1785-788.</P>
<P>37. For lists or chains of vices and virtues, see I.2.1; 39; II.40.1; and 
<U>Great Letter</U> 10 and 21.</P>
<P>38. On the Evagrian pedagogy, see Driscoll, <U>The "Ad Monachos"</U> 25-44 
and 361-384, and on the sources of the vocabulary through fourth century usage 
in monastic circles, J. Raasch, "The Monastic Concept of Purity of Heart and its 
Sources", <U>Studia Monastica</U> 8.1-2 (1966) 7-33 and 183-213, 10.1 (1968) 
7-55, 11.2 (1969) 269-314, and 12.1 (1970) 7-41.</P>
<P>39. For the "Messalian" dossier, see M. Kmosko, <U>Liber Graduum</U>, in 
<U>Patrologia Syriaca</U> III (Paris:1926) clxxii-ccxciii; and for discussion of 
the lists of errors and evolution of the controversy, Stewart, <U>"Working the 
Earth"</U> 12-69.</P>
<P>40. The modern literature on Macarius as "Messalian" begins with L. 
Villecourt, "La date et l'origine des 'Homelies spirituelles' attribuees a 
Macaire", <U>Comptes rendus du l'Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres</U> 
(Paris:1920) 250-258, and reaches perhaps its most virulent expression in I. 
Hausherr's "L'erreur fontamentale et la logique du Messalianisme", <U>OCP</U> 1 
(1935) 328-360, where Macarius emerges as a virtual compendium of heresies. For 
a more recent and balanced discussion, see V. Desprez, "Introduction", <U>SC</U> 
275, pp.38-56.</P>
<P>41. On Jewish asceticism in the Second Temple era, see S.P. Fraade, 
"Ascetical Aspects of Ancient Judaism", in <U>Jewish Spirituality</U>, Vol. I: 
<U>From the Bible to the Middle Ages</U>, ed. A. Green (NY:1988) 253-288; and 
for the visionary element in temple worship and apocalyptic, see for example J. 
Levenson, "The Jerusalem Temple in Devotional and Visionary Experience", 
<U>ibid.</U> 32-64, and C.R. Rowland, <U>The Open Heaven: A Study of Apocalyptic 
in Judaism and Early Christianity</U> (NY:1982), esp. 9-22 and 214-247. On 
motivations for earliest Christian asceticism, see G. Kretschmar, "Ein Beitrag 
zur Frage nach dem Ursprung fruehchristlicher Askese", <U>Z.f.Theologie 
u.Kirche</U> 64 (1961) 27-67, and P. Nagel, <U>Die Motivierung der Askese in der 
alten Kirche und der Ursprung des Moenchtums</U> (Berlin:1966), esp. 20-74 on 
eschatological anticipation and the ascetic as pneumatophor. On the Thomas 
tradition, see A.F.J. Klijn, "Das Thomasevangelium und das altsyrische 
Christentum", <U>Vigiliae christianae</U> 15 (1961) 146-159; G. Quispel, "The 
Study of Encratism: A Historical Survey", in <U>La Tradizione

<P>43. Stewart, <U>"Working"</U> 69 and 234-240.</P>
<P>44. For some echoes of this controversy in Macarius, see the citations below 
from I.17.3 and 52.1-2, together with my discussion. Macarius also clearly takes 
issue against the exaggerated claims of perfection and dispassion singled out by 
the bishops' complaints. See his insistence that no one in this life is either 
perfect or secure in I.39 (conceit is the enemy); 64; II.8.5; 15.8 and 20; 
17.5-6; 38.4-5; and III.7-3-4 (vs. pretended spiritual guides). See also his 
occasional reminders that grace can work hiddenly, i.e., with out conscious 
perception, in the soul, as in, e.g., I.34 and III.14.2l. </P>
<P>45. <U>Great Letter</U> 1-3, and see Staats, <U>Epistola Magna</U> 23-26 and 
63-66.</P>
<P>46. See esp. III.22.1-2.</P>
<P>47. I.1.10.1-2.</P>
<P>48. I.1.10.4-5.</P>
<P>49. I.1.10.5</P>
<P>50. I offer this particularly in response to I. Hausherr's assertions, in 
"L'erreur fondamentale" 337-338, that Macarius simply identifies grace with the 
conscious -- and necessarily spectacular -- perception of grace. This not true, 
as also in n.44 above.</P>
<P>51. For the spiritual senses in Origen, see esp. his <U>Dialogue with 
Heracleides</U>, in <U>SC</U> 67, pp.78-102, together with K. Rahner, "Le debut 
d'une doctrine des cinq sens spirituels chez Origene", <U>Revue d'ascetique et 
de mystique</U> 13 (1934) 113-145, and, for a wider survey of the theme in Greek 
Christian literature, B. Julien-Fraigneau, <U>Les sens spirituels et la vision 
de Dieu chez saint Symeon le nouveau theologien</U> (Paris:1985). On the use of 
<U>aisthesis</U> in Macarius, see Stewart, <U>"Working"</U> 116-138.</P>
<P>52. II.8.3, in <U>Pseudo-Macarius: The Fifty Spiritual Homilies</U> 82.</P>
<P>53. II.8.6, <U>Ibid.</U> 84.</P>
<P>54. See, for example, his insistence that the visitation is foreign, 
<U>xenon</U>, to our nature and, by implication and occasionally specifically, 
not a created thing in I.18.6.2 ("foreign" and "eternal light"); 50.1 (the 
"uncreated [<U>aktiston</U>] Spirit"]; 58.2 (not a product of the intellect, a 
<U>noema</U>, but <U>phos hypostatikon</U>); II.4.7-8; 6.5-7 ("uncreated 
crowns"); 24.5-6 ("foreign to our nature"), 26.19 (the same); III.2.1 (same); 
22.2 ("divine power and fire"); 25.3 ("light of the Holy Spirit"); and the 
<U>Great Letter</U> 25-27 (the activity of the Holy Spirit is "supernatural", 
<U>hyper physin</U>). </P>
<P>55. I.17.1.3.</P>
<P>56. For example, the following from the <U>Tomos of the Holy Mountain</U>, 
the hesychast manifesto written by Palamas around 1339, "If anyone maintains 
that the light which shone about the disciples on Mount Tabor was an apparition 
and a symbol of the kind that now is and now is not, but has no real 
being..[he].contends against the doctrine of the saints...[who] call this light 
ineffable, uncreated, eternal, timeless...archtypal and unchanging beauty, the 
glory of God, the glory of Christ, the glory of the Spirit...", from the 
translation by K. T. Ware, et alii, <U>The Philokalia</U> (London:1995), 
Vol.IV:422. Macarius is, in fact, one of the saints Gregory invokes by name 
earlier on (<U>Ibid.</U> 421) I shall come back to the importance of the term, 
"glory", in my discussion and n.59 below.</P>
<P>57. I.58.1-2; cf. the shorter catenae in I.17.1; 21; and 29.2</P>
<P>58. For appeals to Moses' encounter with the divine glory on Sinai in Ex. 34 
as a type of the Christian, see I.2.3.14; II.12.14; and 47.1; for Ezekiel's 
chariot, see I.29.1; II.1 ff. (discussed below); and 33.2; and, for a sampling 
of Macarius' use of the Johannine texts, I.4.7; 18.4; 22.2; 29.1; 35; II.15.38; 
III.16.4 and 28.2.</P>
<P>59. Beyer, "Lichtlehre" 498ff; and cf. Hausherr, "Les grands courants" 
121-124. "Neoplatonist" is one of those words, beloved of some scholars, which 
is too often used without a great deal of precision and simply attached to 
phenomena which the writer does not like very much. With regard to most fourth 
century Christian writers, it really serves more as an epithet than as a useful 
designation. For "glory" in Macarius, see I.2.1; 10.3; 35; 58.1; II.4.13 
(identified with the "unapproachable light" of I Tim. 6:16); 12.8-9 (Adam and 
Moses clothed with it); 15:38 (citing Jn 17:22-24); 20.2 ("vesture of glory"); 
25.3 (to be "participants of divine glory"); 47.1; III.2.1; 3.3; 16.8 ("vesture 
of glory"); 28.4 (to become "pure temples" with "glory in heart").</P>

these texts in Jewish and Christian thought, see the articles by Levenson and 
Morray-Jones cited above, n.20, as well as the articles and books by A. Segal, 
notably <U>Two Powers in Heaven: Early Rabbinic Reports about Christianity and

<P>64. II.1.2 (my translation).</P>
<P>65. On the rabbinical literature of ascent to the divine "palaces" 
(<U>hekhalot</U>), and its dating to the era of the Talmud, the pioneer of 
modern studies was Gershom Scholem. See esp. his <U>Major Trends in Jewish 
Mysticism</U> (3rd rev. ed., Jerusalem:1973) 1-79, and <U>Jewish Gnosticism, 
Merkabah Mysticism, and Talmudic Tradition</U> (2nd.ed., NY:1965). I. Gruenwald 
traces the continuity from apocalyptic literature in <U>Apocalyptic and Merkavah 
Mysticism</U> (Leiden:1980) and, although his and Scholem's views on continuity 
were subsequently challenged by P. Schaefer, "New Testament and Hekhalot 
Literature: The Journey into Heaven in Paul and Merkavah Mysticism", <U>Journal 
of Jewish Studies</U> 35 (1984) 19-35, and ibidem, <U>The Hidden and Manifest 
God: Some Major Themes in Early Jewish Mysticism</U> (NY:1992) which rejects 
"mysticism" altogether, xi-10, in which he is joined by D. Halperin's resolutely 
sceptical and literary approach in <U>Faces of the Chariot:Early Jewish 
Responses to Ezekiel's Vision</U> (Tuebingen:1988) esp. 1-114, Morray-Jones has 
recently published an impressive response, "Paradise Revisited (2 Cor. 12:1-12): 
The Jewish Mystical Background of Paul's Apostolate", in <U>Harvard Theological 
Review</U> 86 (1993) 177-217 and 265-292, seconded with some reservations by A. 
Goshen-Gottstein, "Four Entered Paradise Revisited", <U>HTR</U> 88 (1995) 
69-133. P.J. Alexander's "Comparing Merkavah Mysticism and Gnosticism", 
<U>JJR</U> 35 (1984) 1-18, provided useful models for persuing the trajectory of 
apocalyptic ascent to heaven from the Second Temple era through Gnosticism, on 
the one hand, and simultaneous rabbinical developments leading to the 
<U>hekhalot</U> texts, on the other. For the texts themselves and critical 
comment, see Schaefer, <U>Synopse zur Hekhalot Literatur</U> (Tuebingen:1981). 
On their precedents in the literature of Qumran, see C. Newson, <U>Songs of the 
Sabbath Sacrifice: A Critical Edition</U> (Atlanta:1985), esp. 39-72, and more 
recently the articles by J. Baumgarten, "The Qumran <U>Sabbath Shirot</U> and 
the Rabbinic Merkabah Tradition", <U>Revue de Qumran</U> 13 (1988) 199-213, and 
D. Diamant and J. Strugnell, "The Merkabah Vision in <U>Second Ezekiel</U> (4Q 
385 4)", <U>RQ</U> 14 (1990) 331-348, esp. 344-48 suggesting a wider interest in 
the "Chariot" than simply among the Qumran sectaries. Thus see also the studies 
by Rowland et alii cited above, nn.40 and 60. For striking echoes in Macarius of 
the imagery of the heavenly realm found often in apocalyptic and the 
<U>hekhalot</U> texts, see esp. I.33.3; II.14.4-5 (the "bright land" of divinity 
and "creatures of fire"); and III.13.2 where the "palaces" and "camps" of the 
angels in the heavens are held out as present possibilities within the soul.</P>
<P>66. We would have none of the OT Pseudepigrapha today were it not for Greek, 
Coptic, Syrian, Ethiopian, Armenian, and even Latin monks. On the continued 
interest in these materials, see most recently R.A. Kraft, "The Pseudepigra in 
Christianity", in J.C. Reeves, ed., <U>Tracing the Threads: Studies in the 
Vitality of Jewish Pseudepigrapha</U> (Atlanta:1994) 55-86. Reeves has himself 
written a valuable study on the impact of the visionary aspect of this 
literature on Mani and early Manichaeanism, <U>Heralds of that Good Realm: 
Syro-Mesopotamian Gnosis and Jewish Traditions</U> (Leiden:1996), esp. 5-30, a 
movement which we note was certainly active in the regions where Macarius lived 
and wrote.</P>
<P>67. From D. Brakke's translation of the Coptic version of the letter, in 
Brakke's <U>Athanasius and the Politics of Asceticism</U> (Oxford:1995) 
330-332.</P>
<P>68. See <U>On the Chariot</U> in Bedjan, <U>Homiliae</U> IV, esp. Jacob's 
emphatic warning that it is not for his listeners to ascend the chariot on high, 
"else you sin in your seeking!", in 605:16-606:6, and his insistence a little 
earlier that "there is no chariot either to ascend to or to seek out" (601:1), 
since, as he argues earlier, the <U>merkabah</U> is not God's secret home, but a 
condescension to the needs of the angels (569:16 - 572:8). For Christians, 
however, the Church's altar offers the same presence and a greater: they are to 
"hold Him fast in the hollows of their hands" Whom the cherubim carry on their 
backs with trembling (609:13-14). On Dionysius' focus on the altar and liturgy, 
see A. Golitzin, "Hierarchy vs. Anarchy? Dionysius Areopagita, Symeon New 
Theologian, Nicetas Stethatos and their Common Roots in Ascetical Tradition", 
<U>St. Vladimir's Theological Quarterly</U> 38 (1994) 131-179, esp. 142-152; and
